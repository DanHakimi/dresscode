Grey chinos. Dark wash jeans. White and light blue button ups. Minimal white sneakers, CP-style. Gray and navy overcoats.</p>
<p>But is that what versatility is really about? For me, a key part of versatility is being able to wear something in casual, business casual, and somewhat more formal contexts. It also helps to have neutral colors and other details that pair well with a variety of options, but <em>minimalism</em> isn't actually required.</p>
<p>And versatility isn't just a nice idea. It allows you to invest more in a smaller number of higher-quality pieces, which is always a great thing.</p>
<p>As you move from a <em>basic</em> wardrobe to a more mature one, you will want some more unique pieces that stand out, or help you stand out. In this article, I intend to explore a few ways you might choose to build on your basic wardrobe while still keeping each piece versatile.</p>

<p>In 1953, Aldo Gucci had a weird fucking idea. The history of menswear has always been linked to horseback riding, but he wanted to try something new. He took a metal horse bit—the thing they put into a horse's mouth to make sure it turns when you pull at the harness (yes, this is kind of horrible)—and he put it on a loafer. The original—a moccasin-style loafer in black calf with gold hardware—was an instant hit.</p>
<p>Mind you, a moccasin-style loafer is generally a very casual dress shoe. But the bit loafer was an expensive shoe in 1953, when the wealthy men were mostly white bankers and stuff like that—the types of men who wore suits. So that's how it was worn, and it's maintained a niche there as a different way to take any suit and make it a little bit flashier.</p>
<p>But they still work great with shorts! See <a href="https://imgur.com/a/DjxdOen">this pair</a> in suede from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Obcdmeme/">/u/Obcdmeme/</a>, and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hLF7sHK">these Carminas</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nipplemonger">/u/nipplemonger</a>. The latter is an apron toe and a sleek last, but it still works!</p>
<p>I own the above Meermins in brown calf, and I love them. They're a statement piece, but one I'm never afraid to wear to work, to parties, on the weekend... I can wholeheartedly recommend bit loafers.</p>

<p>Playing with texture is fun. Corduroy is chino's softer, tufted cousin, with a striped wale texture. It's velvet, except much more wearable and easier to maintain. And although denim, chino, and wool are treated as the most basic and common trouser materials, there's nothing Corduroy can't do. I'm generally recommending &quot;corduroys&quot;—that is to say, corduroy trousers—but of course, these are just ideas, and a corduroy jacket or shirt might take you far.</p>
<p>Dress it up with soft tailoring, or down with knitwear or a flannel. Pair it with suede. Seek inspiration from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thisishirokisamerica">/u/thisishirokisamerica</a>, who made two inspo albums on the material—<a href="https://imgur.com/a/0rEcDeR">CorduRoy G. Biv</a>, organized by color, and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Cu4hN7r">Corduroy Boy But Make It Spring/Summer</a>. It's no wonder reddit has fallen in love with them.</p>
<p>Just choose your pair carefully. Color is the obvious factor: corduroy takes on color well, enabling things like a bright orange, but an orange pair might be less versatile than a navy blue. But also consider pocket layout. Slant pockets are probably more versatile, whereas the five-pocket layout forces a casual appearance. It might also be worth considering wale width. Trousers generally use a wider wale, and jackets and shirts a narrower wale, but again, this is up to you.</p>
<p>With that warning, I arm you with knowledge: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ay06yb/your_favorite_for_corduroy_pants/">use these brand recommendations wisely</a>.</p>

<p>A safari jacket can, likewise, be dressed up or down. You can't really wear it over a suit or blazer, but it can look great with a tie, an open collar, a turtleneck, or a <a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/the-jaunty-scarf/">jaunty scarf</a>. Fashionbeans called it <a href="https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/safari-jacket-men/">2018’s Most Stylish And Practical Menswear Item</a>... although the article currently says 2019, and I assume it will say 2020 soon enough, because they think they'll sell you more if they lie and pretend they just wrote the article five minutes ago... But still, Safari Jackets are interesting and cool.</p>
<p>The above &quot;<a href="https://stoffa.co/products/outerwear-003-field-jacket">field jacket</a>&quot; from Stoffa features a beautiful cinched waist. A safari jacket generally also has four pockets, and might also have lapels with large notches, or a few other features—the definition is certainly a little ambiguous.</p>

<p>Chambray—denim's softer cousin—is one of the menswear crowd's favorite magic tricks. It echoes workwear, making for a shirt that looks perfectly good untucked in the summer, but just watch <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedressedchest/">@thedressedchest</a> wear it with a tie under corduroy above. Or check <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3OmUdFD-TD/">here</a> to see it under a denim blazer. Crazy!</p>
<p>Chambray is one of those textures that can provide complexity without taking up too much attention. See <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CPGfNmV">this take</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DebonaireGamer/">/u/debonairegamer</a>. Pay attention not only to shade and drape but collar style, pocket layout, plackets, stitching, wrinkling, and body length.</p>
<p>There's a reason Put This On called chambray a &quot;<a href="https://putthison.com/chambray-a-workhorse-casual-shirt/">workhorse</a>.&quot; And Ethan Wong got <a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2018/07/01/an-ode-to-denim-and-chambray-shirts/">a little obsessed</a>. Maybe you can be too. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8zvxdh/your_favorite_for_chambray_shirts/">Here are some recommendations</a>. Be careful.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="havefunexploring">Have Fun Exploring!</h1>
<p>Remember, I can't tell you how to branch out. I don't expect you to buy all of the above—I don't have everything I listed above myself. These were just ideas to help get your creative juices flowing. If you're branching out past your basic wardrobe, it's important for you to branch out and make your own choices.</p>
<p>So hopefully, I've gotten you thinking less about the exact styles above, and more about interesting textures, metal hardware, a cinched waist, and wearing things you haven't worn before. Good luck, and have fun.</p>

Suffice it to say, you want some J. Fitzpatricks.</p>
<p>Leffot is just across the street, and yesterday was a beautiful day, so I popped right over for a quick look at their selection. There were some nice Aldens and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GDWzY5g">Corthays</a>, some <a href="https://imgur.com/AAWcd9H">scarves from Drake's</a>, and a <a href="https://imgur.com/SvHV6Yc">very large wheel of Pantherella socks</a>. They had <a href="https://imgur.com/pev0pcb">horns made of horn</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/dg9sMJV">house slippers from Hiro Yanagimachi</a>, creams, nice photos... It was all very nice.</p>
<p>Speaking of Corthay -- today (Thursday) and tomorrow, Leffot his hosting a Corthay trunk show, so if you have money to blow, go get some dope, unique shoes.</p>
<p>Also -- <a href="https://imgur.com/0cy7BmI">I bought something!</a> Take your guesses as to what's in that bag.</p>

<li><a href="https://vass-shoes.com/sites/default/files/styles/shoes_front_page_collection/public/shoes/5069-s-museum_plum-single_sole.jpg?itok=Kbp0aZoJ"><strong>Chisel Toe</strong></a>. Comes close to a point, but squares off near the end. Weirdly a lot better than point or square. Dressy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.stacyadams.com/shop/images/21187-221.jpg"><strong>Square</strong></a>. Ugly. Used by cheap shoes. Ferragamo is famous for making these look not that bad, and distinctive... But still not good.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lacedshoestyles">Laced Shoe Styles</h1>
<p>I started writing this guide in an attempt to catch everything worth catching. I ended up running into more styles than I could really hope to capture... But hopefully, this is good enough.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/captoe_oxfords_burgundy_boxcalf_594_l.jpg"><strong>Oxfords</strong></a> (See also <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/balmoral-boots/"><strong>Balmoral Boots</strong></a>). Oxfords are shoes with closed lacing. &quot;Balmoral&quot; actually means there is a horizontal line around the shoe or boot.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/924x805/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/N/e/Newbury_915_NIGCALF_main.jpg"><strong>Wholecut</strong></a>. A beautiful style that puts the quality of the leather on display. People disagree about how formal these are; some argue they're more formal than cap toe oxfords, since they're simpler, and others argue that they're more casual, because they show wear more. Note that, in black patent leather, these are one of three valid options for black tie appropriate footwear.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.allenedmonds.com/dw/image/v2/AAXI_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-allenedmonds-catalog/default/dwe37b2ea5/images/2.1/mens-shoes/mackenzie-3446-walnut-pair-web.jpg?sw=736&amp;sh=736&amp;sm=fit"><strong>Medallion Toe</strong></a>. Can come with a number of features, but here is the pure, almost wholecut, medallion toe.</li>
<li>&quot;<a href="https://www.allenedmonds.com/dw/image/v2/AAXI_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-allenedmonds-catalog/default/dwc9a0b056/images/2.1/mens-shoes/carlyle-8833-darkchili-angle-web.jpg?sw=736&amp;sh=736&amp;sm=fit"><strong>Plain Toe</strong></a>.&quot; The plain toe oxford is kinda dumb. It's not as classic as the cap toe, but it's also missing the sleekness of the wholecut. It's not bad, it's just not really the best of anything.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.allenedmonds.com/dw/image/v2/AAXI_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-allenedmonds-catalog/default/dw019394d1/images/2.1/mens-shoes/parkave-5615-black-pair-web.jpg?sw=2000&amp;sh=2000&amp;sm=fit"><strong>Cap Toe</strong></a>. Absolute staple in black. The quintessential boring business shoe and suit complement.</li>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/captoe-oxfords_brown_80201_l.jpg"><strong>Perforated Cap Toe</strong></a>. Note that it's somewhat hard to draw the lines between a PCT, quarter brogue, and semi brogue, but generally, I would say that the PCT is just a cap toe with perforations, a quarter brogue adds perforations around the quarters of the shoe, and a semi brogue adds a medallion. A wingtip swaps out the cap toe for a particular pattern, which you'll see.</li>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/adelaide_oxfords_shoes_burgundy_museum_80512_l.jpg"><strong>Quarter Brogue</strong></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-oxford-shoes/lace-up-semi-brogue-brown-10051"><strong>Semi Brogue</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Full Brogue</strong> / <strong>Wingtip</strong> -- replace the cap toe with a curvy &quot;wing&quot; pattern.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/oxford_shoes_tan_922_carmina_l-7.jpg"><strong>Shortwing</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Notice how the wings curve down at the middle of the shoe?</li>
<li><strong>Longwing</strong> / &quot;<strong>Gunboat</strong>.&quot; (I couldn't find a photo of longwing oxfords, please share one if you have one. Here, the lines extend from the wings, horizontally, all the way to the back. This also makes them &quot;<strong>balmorals</strong>.&quot; People tend to call all oxfords balmorals, but balmoral refers specifically to the existence of a horizontal line like on a longwing oxford.</li>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/austerity_brogue_brown_80270_l-2.jpg"><strong>Austerity</strong> &quot;<strong>Brogue</strong>.&quot;</a> Wingtips <em>without</em> brouging, and without the medallion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bluchers</strong> and <strong>Derbies</strong> (See also derby/blucher boots, including <a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/shoes/banbury-dark-oak-antique-calf-202-last.html"><strong>chukka boots</strong></a>). Technically different, bluchers and derbies both have open lacing and tend to be lumped together. Bluchers and Derbies are noticeably more casual than oxfords.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.styleforum.net/data/attachments/759/759578-b9916dc7ba7c9368e4451214a1af4b15.jpg"><strong>Plain Toe</strong> / &quot;<strong>PTBs</strong>.&quot;</a> Plain Toe Bluchers -- particularly in a dark color with a contrasting welt as shown here, and with a round or bulbous toe -- are reddit standards. See Tricker's Robert (shown here in black shell) and <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/WbEAAOSwceVdO0vW/s-l1600.jpg">Alden's Color 8 Shell PTBs</a>. Note that <a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/derby_shoes_black_carmina_80449_l.jpg">plain toe derbies</a> also exist, but I'd prefer a blucher.</li>
<li><a href="https://aldenmadison.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2160.jpg"><strong>Cap Toe</strong></a>. Kinda silly; meant for oxfords. Not wrong or bad, just not the best in its class.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-derby-shoes/captoe-derby-brown-soft-grain-748"><strong>Perforated Cap Toe</strong></a>. Derbies here.</li>
<li><a href="https://vass-shoes.com/sites/default/files/styles/shoes_front_page_collection/public/shoes/5100-f-museum_brown-single_sole.jpg?itok=fP1OdbO-"><strong>Quarter Brouge</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/shoes/cardiff-horween-cordovan-black-202-last.html"><strong>Semi Brogue</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Full Brogue</strong> / <strong>Wingtip</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.trickers.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/ecd051e9670bd57df35c8f0b122d8aea/7/2/7292_1_keswick_top_original_65796_1.jpg"><strong>Shortwing</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Much more common. ]</li>
<li><a href="https://i1.wp.com/fromsqualortoballer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSCF3898.jpg?w=1995&amp;ssl=1"><strong>Longwing</strong> / &quot;<strong>Gunboat</strong>.&quot;</a> Longwing bluchers are a Reddit favorite, particularly vintage Florsheim Imperials. Note that there's technically no such thing as a longwing derby.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/86CHa5a.jpg"><strong>Austerity</strong> &quot;<strong>Brogue</strong>&quot;</a> -- Boots, because this was the only good photo I could find.</li>

<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/nowegian_shoes_brown_757_EEE_l.jpg"><strong>Norweigan Split-Toe</strong></a>. A more casual style than many realize; deceptively tricky to wear.</li>
<li><a href="https://n.nordstrommedia.com/ImageGallery/store/product/Zoom/7/_102290987.jpg?h=365&amp;w=240&amp;dpr=2&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=fill&amp;fm=jpg"><strong>Bicycle Toe</strong></a>. Dumb-looking, associated with cheap shoes. Avoid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sliponshoes">Slip-on shoes</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wildsmith.com/img/main_shoe_images/windsor-mocha.jpg"><strong>Loafers</strong></a>. A loafer is a slip-on dress shoe with a rigid sole, heel, and seam around the front.
<ul>
<li><strong>Construction Style</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wildsmith.com/img/main_shoe_images/windsor-mocha.jpg"><strong>Standard</strong></a>. Lasted from the top down, like traditional laced dress shoes. Generally dressy. Invented by Wildsmith Shoes.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zNsleCi.jpg"><strong>Moccasin</strong></a>. Lasted from the bottom up, like actual moccasins. Generally casual. Invented by Aurland Shoes. Yes, this photograph is of my feet.</li>
<li><a href="https://belgianshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mr_casual_suede_7.jpg"><strong>Belgian</strong></a>. Derived from velvet dress slippers. Invented by Belgian Shoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toe Styles</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wildsmith.com/img/main_shoe_images/windsor-mocha.jpg"><strong>Apron Toe</strong></a>. Thin seam, top-down construction.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zNsleCi.jpg"><strong>Moc Toe</strong></a>. A thicker seam, associated with moccasin construction.</li>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/black_penny_loafers_80190_l.jpg"><strong>Split Toe</strong></a><strong>.</strong> That seam down the front.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.stacyadams.com/shop/images/21187-221.jpg"><strong>Bicycle Toe</strong></a>. Ugly, associated with cheap shoes as discussed above. Avoid. Not really even loafers, by my definition, since the seam doesn't go around all the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vamp Styles</strong>. Most loafers are named by the vamp style.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://224220-www.web.tornado-node.net/assets/uploads/2019/03/aurlands18022-2560x1440.jpg"><strong>Penny Loafer</strong></a>. Classic ivy style. Invented by <a href="https://wildsmith.com/img/main_shoe_images/windsor-mocha.jpg">Wildsmith</a> and <a href="https://224220-www.web.tornado-node.net/assets/uploads/2019/03/aurlands18022-2560x1440.jpg">Aurland</a> shoes.</li>
<li><a href="https://brooksbrothers.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/033H_BURGUNDY?$bbenlarged$"><strong>Tassel Loafer</strong></a>. Invented by Alden + Brooks Brothers.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/39/0a/07/390a0701bbcd6b3d830dd10756e1f1f1--loafers.jpg"><strong>Kilted Tassel Loafer</strong></a>. God, these look dumb. I spent longer than I expected looking for one that didn't look <em>that</em> dumb, but they all look dumb.</li>
<li><a href="https://brooksbrothers.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MH00153_TAN_3?$bbenlarged$"><strong>Venetian Loafer</strong></a> (plain). Almost always moc toe. Generally a cheap style, although not as bad as bicycle toe. Note that plain-vamp Belgian loafers are not called &quot;Venetian&quot; loafers, because that would be weird. Also, for some reason, Brooks Brothers calls these &quot;American Loafers,&quot; maybe because the moccasin style is American... But that's all quite confusing.</li>

<li><a href="https://belgianshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mr_casual_allcalf_5.jpg"><strong>Bow</strong></a>. Exclusively for Belgian loafers.</li>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/string_suede_loafer_carmina_80228_l.jpg"><strong>String Loafer</strong></a>. Carmina in Snuff Suede is the classic. Casual style.</li>
<li><a href="https://i1.adis.ws/i/tom_ford/J1060T-VSP_NER_OS_C?$large$&amp;bg=rgb(255,255,255)"><strong>Chain</strong></a>. A few high-fashion designers like Tom Ford are trying to make this a thing now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Slippers</strong> / &quot;<strong>Wholecut Loafers</strong>.&quot; Not what most people call &quot;slippers.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/slippers_black_pantent_80445_l.jpg"><strong>Black patent leather opera pumps with a grosgrain or satin bow</strong></a>. Yes, all of those elements are important -- do you want your shoe to be a. black tie appropriate or b. ugly?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/924x805/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/R/o/Royal_Albert_389_BURVEL_main.jpg"><strong>Velvet / Prince Albert / Smoking Slippers</strong></a>. In plain black, these are black tie appropriate. In any other color or with any crest/medallion/piping/embroidering, they are not -- they're just flashy as hell. Maybe good for creative black tie, for your fancy dinner party, or for your weird fashionny look.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/924x805/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/A/l/Albert_389_NAVSKID_main.jpg"><strong>Suede Slippers</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Cool stuff. Some argue that black suede is a good substitute for black velvet in black tie. Not traditional, but you'll pass.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="elasticclosure">Elastic Closure</h1>
<p>These shoes are arguably still slip-ons.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dhb3yazwboecu.cloudfront.net/909/chelsea_boots_black_box_calf_80186_l.jpg"><strong>Chelsea boots</strong></a>. Ideally wholecut, or near wholecut, with a seam at the bottom of the elastic. Versatile, to the point where the same pair can potentially be worn with jeans or a suit.</li>
<li>&quot;<a href="https://www-saintcrispins-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/21955_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;fit=2500%2C2500&amp;ssl=1"><strong>Lazyman Oxfords</strong></a>.&quot; A lot of very high-end shoemakers (Saint Crispin's, in this case) have been making oxford-lookalike shoes with elastic closures and faux lacing. They're an interesting oddity here; you might expect these to carry the same connotation as a pre-tied bow tie, but... They're one of those things that's acceptable only because the brands doing it are highly respected British brands, and because they are, they're practically conservative.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="buckleclosure">Buckle Closure</h1>
<p>All of the below shoes look best with a plain toe.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://meermin.com/media/catalog/product/cache/image/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/1/0/10157420140000SE-1.jpg"><strong>Single Monkstrap</strong></a>. Shown here with a medallion toe.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="buttonclosure">Button Closure</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/3674/6355/products/j-fitzpatrick-footwear-collection-15-november-2017-01_1024x1024_34c99d20-fffb-4832-ae2e-662c4aebe57c_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1542626760"><strong>Button Boots</strong></a></li>

<h1 id="zipper">Zipper</h1>

<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nbyJdzt.jpg"><strong>Side-zip Boots</strong></a>. In the same class as Chelseas and Jodhpurs, a sleek boot</li>
<li><strong>Dual-closure Boots</strong>. That is to say, any boot with a zipper and also some other closure. Like a chelsea with a zipper on one side, or something like that. Silly; avoid.</li>

It wasn't a vacation... It was a family emergency, but it was a month-long emergency, so I found myself needing a break. I was fortunate enough to be in an apartment just blocks away from Supply and Advise, so I went over there a couple of times and took photos.</p>
<p>As /u/mcadamsandwich described it in the local shopping megathread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/">Supply &amp; Advise</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upscale menswear shop that has a dual personality (like most of us) - on the first floor you'll find Americana and military-inspired collections featuring brands like Alden, RRL, orSlow, The Real McCoys, Filson, etc. Take the elevator to the second floor to be wooed by their top notch suiting collection featuring brands like Ring Jacket, Hamilton, Drake's, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan and Kevin are super friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My favorite pieces were Drake's grenadines and ancient madders... And also a GBV camp collar shirt that fit me shockingly well -- a little long in the body but otherwise beautifully. But none of that was on sale... And I can't really afford their regular prices. Still, they were nice to me and poured me some of that Hibiki 12 year, so I'm going to do the least I can do and post about it here. And tell you to visit, or to buy something from their website -- you'll be glad you did. (Especially if you catch a good sale).</p>
<p>I was a little more focused on the second floor. The first floor had plenty of goodies from EG, Unis (low stock right now, but more coming), 8.15, Beams+, GBV, and everything /u/mcadamsandwich mentioned. They also mentioned to me that they're bringing in some 100 Hands shirting pretty soon -- they make great fucking shirts.</p>
<p>Other pieces of note not featured in my album included bombers and shirting from Beams+, seersucker from GBV, Velva Sheen tees and a sweatshirt, and cotton piqué / marcella shirting from Ring Jacket.</p>

I initially told the story through the inspiration album, but I reproduced it here in plain text as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Symmetry has always been something people appreciate, whether consciously or not. This is true not only in clothing, but everything, from nature, to fine art, to facial expressions. A lot of studies show that facial symmetry is a huge factor in attractiveness, and that people treat attractive people better everywhere, not just in romance, so... It seems like it might be important.</p>
<p>If symmetry is so important, I want to talk about the reasons a fashion designer might avoid it, and what we can get out of that. I hope it's as interesting to all of you as it is to me.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Asymmetry is largely about weirdness, to me. It's about going off-balance on purpose, on throwing away classic silhouettes and predictable patterns for something that clashes with itself, and demands a new perspective. You're going to see a lot more weird shit in this album. Enjoy.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Facial symmetry is supposed to be important... but no face is 100% symmetrical. There's always some imperfection, some... wabi-sabi to a person's face. Cindy Crawford is famous for the mole that got her teased as a kid. How much imperfection is the right amount? How much is too much?</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I mentioned the importance of facial symmetry for a reason. Back in 2012, I came down with a case of Bell's Palsy. Bell's Palsy is a weird little disease; basically, one nerve in your face gets paralyzed, and half of your face stops working right. It usually occurs once, at random, and usually only lasts a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Bell's Palsy fucks with both your conscious and subconscious control of your face. It fucks with your smile. You know, worse things have happened -- it's not going to kill me, it's not going to stop me from doing much, so I have to count my blessings... But not being able to smile properly, it has all sorts of weird psychological effects They say smiling actually makes you happier -- well, when you get self-conscious about your smile, you smile less. And if you know facial symmetry is important to how you're perceived... Friends will say they don't notice, but others will say that they love your smirk. Strangers on the internet will say they hate your smirk, and they'd prefer if you just smiled. So yeah, people notice, they just don't understand what it is they're looking at. You don't necessarily understand, yourself, when you look in the mirror. Not being able to smile, man... It fucks with you.</p>

<p>My case of Bell's Palsy was not so simple as others. I had it briefly a couple of times when I was a kid, but it came and went. It happened again in 2012. My neurologist told me not to worry, until a short while later, when we realized it was permanent. She said the closest thing we had to a solution was a nerve graft, and... I don't know if you've heard the words &quot;nerve graft&quot; before, but they're two scary fucking words.  At this point, even if my seventh facial nerve started working again, the muscles it controls probably couldn't do what I'd need them to do. It's a part of me now.</p>

I've seen a lot of that advice getting upvoted. In particular, there was one thread where people were telling a guy to throw out his old suit jacket after he lost his pants. That is <em>terrible</em> advice. I've also seen some of this bad advice upvoted in SQ. So I want to clarify some things -- at least from my perspective.</p>
<h1 id="whatisthedifferencebetweenasuitjacketandablazer">What is the difference between a suit jacket and a blazer?</h1>
<p>Some of you don't seem to understand this. While certain details are more appropriate for blazers than suit jackets, those aren't the defining distinction. The difference between a suit jacket and blazer is the existence of matching pants. If there are no matching pants, it's a blazer. If there are, it's a suit jacket. That's it. (The difference between a blazer and a sportcoat is technically pattern -- a blazer has to be solid -- but nobody knows or cares about that).</p>
<p>Generally, a Blazer might be a more casual thing. Certain fabrics like hopsack, tweed, and wool flannel might be better for a blazer than for a suit. High-contrast buttons like gold buttons are really not right for a suit but at home on a blazer. Patch pockets and minimal structure look more casual, too, so they might be better on a blazer. But these details are not part of the definition, so, when you're wearing a suit jacket without the matching pants, you are, as far as anybody else knows, wearing a blazer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zegna.ca/ca-en/ready-to-wear/techmerino/product.techmerino-wash-&amp;-go-flannel-suit.10296171.html">Here's a suit with patch pockets</a>. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/IbKEbj4">Here's Jason Jules in another suit with patch pockets</a>. <a href="https://therake.com/stories/style/what-is-a-blazer/">Here are a bunch of blazers with various types of pockets and buttons</a> (although The Rake uses a more historical / naval definition).</p>
<p>This is crucial, and so many people are getting it wrong. The objects are the same. The difference is metaphysical -- it's the existence of matching pants.</p>
<h1 id="bepreparedtoforsakethesuit">Be prepared to forsake the suit.</h1>
<p>If you can style it right, the main reason not to wear a suit jacket as a blazer has to do with wear and tear.</p>
<p>If you wear and dry clean your suit jacket and pants together, they will wear at the same rate and retain the same color. They'll look better together.</p>
<p>But if you wear hem apart from one another, they will wear differently, and you might not be able to wear them together anymore.</p>
<p>If you're willing to accept that risk, you're too poor to buy a separate blazer, or you lost your pants, then congratulations: your suit jacket is now a blazer. It's that easy!</p>
<p>But you still need to worry about styling! So let's consider the normal styling concerns for blazers, all of which apply for wearing suit jackets as blazers, since they're the same damn things.</p>
<h1 id="makesurethecolorswork">Make sure the colors work.</h1>
<p>Since a suit is a <em>matching</em> combination, a blazer and the trousers you wear with it have to <em>not</em> match. How not-matchy is not-matchy enough?</p>
<p>This can be hard to put into words. I could tell you that you can or can't wear navy with charcoal, or medium blue, but the reality is that... It depends. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeyoNCUlwu_/">Here</a> is a navy blazer with charcoal pants, and they look great together. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mM2vKQh">Here's</a> another.</p>
<p>It depends on the shades of those colors, the lighting of the room you're going to be in, and how well people think you normally dress -- they'll be quicker to judge you if they think you're likely to mess this up.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the only hard rule is, the colors need to contrast enough, given the  context, that people can tell that you are dressing with intentionality. If that's too vague a rule for you, welcome to the sub.</p>
<p>As a final note, remember that black is weird in the US, and hard to pair with anywhere.</p>
<h1 id="makesurethepatternsworktogether">Make sure the patterns work together.</h1>
<p>When it came to color, we require clear contrast. In pattern, however, we have some choices. These relate pretty reasonably to your usual pattern concerns -- the main thing being, don't clash.</p>
<p>Solid + solid is a perfectly good combination. Solid + pattern usually works as well. Matching patterns (other than solid) is probably bad. Any two loud patterns are probably bad. A loud pattern and a subdued pattern might work -- when in doubt, look for a second opinion.</p>
<p>Note that a contrasting pattern might help a lot in a relatively low-contrast color pairing. For example, while navy + dark charcoal is a difficult combination, solid navy + heavily specked dark charcoal <em>might</em> look great.</p>
<h1 id="makesurethefabricsworktogether">Make sure the fabrics work together.</h1>
<p>As with pattern, the rules here are not very simple. But there is a good guiding principle. Generally, two fabrics have to match, or at least not clash, in formality and seasonality.</p>
<p>The clearest example here would be wearing linen with tweed or wool flannel. You'll probably be uncomfortable in that combination anyway, wherever you go... But you'll also look dumb. (It should also go without saying that tuxedo pants and dinner jackets should only be worn with other eveningwear).</p>
<p>But at the margins, things get hazy. Can you wear a tweed sportcoat with a midweight chino? Can you wear your highly structured navy suit jacket with burgundy chinos with slant pockets but no crease? Can you wear your white double breasted wool-silk-linen blend with lightweight jeans? These are all good, weird questions.</p>
<h1 id="considerotherfactors">Consider other factors.</h1>
<p>These factors don't really have hard and fast rules, but are worth considering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fit. You might try a slim-fitting blazer with high-rise wide-legged pants, cropped pants, pants with or without socks... Again, do this with intentionality.</li>
<li>Shirt -- a solid white dress shirt works with everything... unless you're trying to dress things down. You have to remember not to clash patterns, and keep things in the same season / formality bracket.</li>
<li>Shoes -- the shoes have to work with the pants, and match the belt. Then, they have to match overall formality. Wearing bluchers can be a good way to signify that you're not trying to wear a suit (even though a suit + bluchers is not necessarily wrong -- oxfords are preferred, but bluchers can definitely work -- it's a step down, which corresponds better to blazer + odd trousers).</li>
<li>Accessories -- you still don't want to over-accessorize. Some accessories, like a tie, up the formality. Others, like a pocket square, allow you to play with another contrasting fabric and add some flair to an otherwise boring look. You can match metals between a watch, blazer buttons, belt, and any shoe hardware to show more intentionality. You can do a lot here.</li>
<li>Waistcoat -- don't do something silly like match a waistcoat to one thing but not the other. A matching waistcoat + blazer with odd trousers will probably look awful.</li>
</ul>

Now, I'm sure a few of you have ideas. You might call it a &quot;derby boot&quot; or a &quot;work boot&quot; or a dozen other things, but I bet a few of you are thinking &quot;it's just a boot.&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;boot&quot; has often times been oversimplified to refer particularly to casual boots. This oversimplification in turn feeds the misunderstanding that all boots are casual. I'm here to remind you that they aren't. A boot is pretty much any shoe that reaches up the ankle. Why would those inherently be any more casual than a lower-cut shoe?</p>
<p>There are plenty of boots out there that qualify as dress boots. Many are office-appropriate, some are suit-and-tie appropriate, and a few are even rooted in eveningwear -- at least historically. And dress boots can be very versatile too -- many of the options below work just fine with jeans. So let's get into details! What is a dress boot?</p>
<h1 id="whatmakesadressbootdressy">What makes a dress boot dressy?</h1>
<p>A casual boot is an often clunky thing rooted in its function. The extreme example is the bean boot -- ugly, thick, and impervious. <a href="https://www.blundstone.com/shop/stout-brown-premium-leather-v-cut-boots-mens-style-500">Blundstones</a> are more moderately chunky Chelsea boots, whereas <a href="https://www.redwingheritage.com/us/USD/product/mens-footwear/6-inch-boots/iron-ranger-copper-r-t-08085">Red Wing Iron Rangers</a> manage to look pretty good while still being casual. <a href="https://www.clarksusa.com/c/Desert-Boot/p/26138221">Clark's Desert Boots</a> aren't too rugged, but they're still quite casual for reasons I'll get into below.</p>
<p>By comparison, dress boots have generally been designed through impractical history. Many were developed based on the whims of royalty or the needs of wealthy men who spent their afternoons riding horseback. They're not made, today, for snow, or for the trenches, but for the man on the town. That's not to say that they won't last -- a well-made and well-maintained pair can last you a decade, same as any shoe you hear about on /r/goodyearwelt.</p>
<p>I'll expand in the individual sections, but let's just explore the general distinction between dressy and casual boot styles:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I will expand on these distinctions further in the category on Dressy Derby Boots, and then further in each of the other categories where the direct clash will be quite evident.</p>
<h1 id="whatarethebestmaterialsforadressboot">What are the best materials for a dress boot?</h1>
<p>The best material for a dress boot is smooth calfskin leather. The leather should be clean, but doesn't need a high-gloss polish by any stretch. A leather sole or rubber sole with a minimal profile is ideal. Some pure traditionalists refuse to accept rubber soles, but they're mostly assholes. Black and dark brown are the best colors, but mid and sometimes even lighter browns can work just fine.</p>
<p>For two-tone boots like button boots and some laced boots, an ankle segment made of tweed, linen or suede is also very appropriate. And colors get a little more interesting there too -- I've even seen purple work.</p>
<p>Pebbled leathers, suede, and shell cordovan are all valid options as well, in about that order. Suede and shell are traditionally considered casual, and are sometimes too eye-catching for subdued business wear, but they can be worn with a suit by the brave, as long as the boot comes in a conservative style. That said, don't try to dress up, say, a chukka boot in these materials. Steer clear of green and burgundy shell, and focus on dark brown suede. Tread carefully.</p>
<p>Waxy leathers, roughout, and -- this should go without saying -- rubber -- are not appropriate materials for dressy boots.</p>
<p>Patent Leather Boots existed at some point, but I can't really find any modern sources on them. These days, boots are not appropriate with eveningwear.</p>
<h1 id="whatstylesqualifyasdressboots">What styles qualify as &quot;Dress Boots?&quot;</h1>
<p>I generally think of <strong>Balmoral</strong> boots, <strong>Chelsea</strong> boots, <strong>Jodhpur</strong> boots and <strong>Button</strong> boots as dressy.</p>
<p>In some  cases, <strong>Derby</strong> boots and <strong>Chukka</strong> boots can also be dressy.</p>
<p>Side Zip boots are... ambiguous, but I don't think they're important enough to dig into here.</p>
<p>Since formality is rooted partly in tradition, &quot;other&quot; boots are usually not dressy.</p>
<p>I will include examples, with purchase links where available, below, sorted <em>roughly</em> by price. I'm listing an absurdly large number of models for you people to explore, but I'm open to more recommendations for this list.</p>
<h1 id="whataredressyderbyboots">What Are Dressy Derby Boots?</h1>
<p>Again, we'll use the <a href="https://www.redwingheritage.com/us/USD/product/mens-footwear/6-inch-boots/iron-ranger-copper-r-t-08085">Red Wing Iron Rangers</a> as the benchmark for casual boots. The last is round and somewhat chunky. The leather has a waxy appearance. The sole is a commando sole. They use high-contrast metal eyelets and thick laces. The welt contrasts slightly with the upper; this is more pronounced on <a href="https://www.redwingheritage.com/us/USD/product/mens-footwear/6-inch-boots/6-black-harness-8114-08114">darker models</a>. You see white contrast stitching and other details that give the shoe a more complex feel. We don't want complex. We want simple.</p>
<p>For contrast, look at these <a href="https://meermin.com/in_en/10148710170000he-17-101487-dark-brown-calf-e-marron.html">Meermins</a> with minimal contrast. Blind eyelets. Subtle stitching. A subtle welt. The speed hooks might not look simple, but they're far enough up the ankle that, with proper trousers on, they'll never be seen. They use a studded rubber sole, but looking at it from the side, you wouldn't be sure. And these Meermins, while sleeker and more subtle than the iron rangers, will still look great with jeans. They're incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>As a middle ground, which I would say is on the casual side, consider Edward Green's <a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/discovery/galway">Galway</a> -- one of the most iconic shoes ever made. You can probably swing it with anything from jeans to dress pants, but I wouldn't try it with a suit -- they're probably the &quot;best&quot; shoes here, but not the most versatile.</p>
<p>One note -- while I am having trouble finding examples, &quot;spectator&quot; boots are very casual. Spectator shoes were originally designed so that your shoes didn't get too dirty while playing... cricket or some other British nonsense.</p>

<h1 id="whatarebalmoralboots">What Are Balmoral Boots?</h1>
<p>So, technically, Balmoral boots are boots with a certain horizontal line along them, which... You don't want to know. Trust me, there's no reason to know that.</p>
<p>In common usage, &quot;Balmoral&quot; is pretty much just another word for &quot;Oxford.&quot; Like an Oxford/Balmoral shoe, the &quot;bal boot&quot; usually refers to a boot with closed lacing. That is to say, at the bottom of the laces, where the &quot;flaps&quot; meet the front of the shoe, the leather is all connected -- it's all one piece. This is as opposed to a Derby or Blucher, where the flaps connect. This <em>sounds</em> about as useless as the technical definition above, but is actually <em>crazy</em> important in distinguishing between more casual and more dressy shoes -- and boots.</p>
<p>While derby boots are usually casual, balmoral boots are almost always dressy. It would take a rather strange design to make a balmoral boot casual. I imagine that Feit has done something like that, but I'm not seeing it on their website right now, so I'll leave your imagination running.</p>
<p><strong>Brands to Consider</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://meermin.com/in_en/10147729170000xe-17-101477-lama-marron-e-marron-marron.html">Meermin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-boots/balmoral-boots-box-calf-black-80092">Carmina</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jfitzpatrickfootwear.com/collections/boots/products/seaview-plum-museum-calf-burgundy-calf">J. Fitzpatrick</a> -- again, dressy, despite the contrasting upper.</li>
<li>Edward Green <a href="https://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/shoes/shannon-dark-oak-antique-calf-202-last.html">Shannon</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="whatarechelseaboots">What Are Chelsea boots?</h1>
<p>A chelsea boot is a laceless shoe with a whole lot of elastic keeping it together. You'll usually see a tab near the opening that makes it easier to put on. It's a little silly to think of these as one of the dressiest boot styles, but they really are. Chelsea boots are fair game with suits -- in my book, at least.</p>
<p>Your chelsea boots should have no broguing. Really, there should be no markings on them anywhere -- they should either be wholecut, or have a very small seam at the bottom of the elastic. That's probably why they're considered dressy -- because they are one big, simple piece of leather. Any marking not only risks making the boot inappropriate with your suit, but generally ugly.</p>
<p>Note that Chelsea Boots can also definitely be worn casually. They're heavily associated with glam rock and SLP styles, and work well with slim jeans. But the Beatles wore theirs with suits. And so will you.</p>
<p>As your examples for each style, consider <a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-boots/chelsea-boots-black-box-calf-80186">Carmina</a> (dressy, versatile), <a href="https://www.blundstone.com/shop/stout-brown-premium-leather-v-cut-boots-mens-style-500">Blundstone</a> (strictly casual, rugged), <a href="https://shop.r10s.jp/mb/cabinet/img207/443213-aqs00-1000_l.jpg">Saint Laurent</a> 40mm Wyatt (dressy, feminine, SLP style). I tend to think of these extreme casual Chelsea boots -- Doc Martens, Blundstones, and Redwings -- as very ugly, and sneaker-style chelseas to be even worse. Since the dressy Chelseas are all much more versatile, and can be worn with jeans just fine, my recommendation, even for those looking for boots to wear with jeans, is to err on the dressy side.</p>

<h1 id="whatarejodhpurboots">What Are Jodhpur Boots?</h1>
<p>Jodhpur boots are boots with a strap and buckle around the top. Rooted in riding heritage, they are pretty consistently dressy. They practically look a lot like Chelseas -- especially from the front -- but obviously swap the elastic setup for something more subtle. The near-wholecut appearance is, again, a staple -- broguing and cap toes are just going to ruin that.</p>
<p>Somebody in the short-lived MFA discord (which never existed) half-joked that Jodhpurs are the new Chelseas. Well, it's not like Chelseas are actually going anywhere, but Jodhpurs may well be on the come-up.</p>

<h1 id="whatarebuttonboots">What Are Button Boots?</h1>
<p>Button boots have a strange, Victorian history that I'd rather not get into. Just know that, when royalty decides they like a boot, no matter how weird it is, it becomes acceptable for the well-to-do to put it on. I've been told that button boots are traditionally related to tuxedo boots, but I can't seem to find a real source on that, or... really on what tuxedo boots actually are.</p>
<p>Note that the contrasting upper from above is back now, and consistently present on essentially all button boots. If you see a tweed or wool or even suede upper, you're in for a relatively comfortable boot with a flexible ankle.</p>
<p>Button boots are quite rare. I'm sure there are more than two brands that make them, but these are the only ones I could think of. Keep in mind that the abnormal nature makes them a little better for Pitti Uomo than your conservative law firm, but wearing them for business isn't wrong, it's just not the most conservative option. Edit: Added St. Crispin's.</p>

<h1 id="whataredressychukkaboots">What Are Dressy Chukka Boots?</h1>
<p>Chukka boots are a relatively new and casual boot. They first started to pop up in the 40s and 50s, and were soon put to use by Clark's as &quot;desert boots&quot; for military use. As you might guess, a crepe soled suede boot meant for military use in the desert is not a formal thing.</p>
<p>However, people experiment with dressier styles, quite a few of which I've listed here. I still am not a huge fan of dressy chukkas (or sneaker-style chukkas, or really any chukkas for that matter), so focus on the casual styles.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.paulevansny.com/collections/boots/products/the-newman-chukka-boot-oxblood">Paul Evans</a> -- an instagram brand, certainly a little overpriced, but excellent out-of-the-box presentation and consistently dressy shoes.</li>

<p>A while back, there was a reddit thread asking whose style we could appreciate, but not pull off ourselves. At the time, I said Hendrix, but 2 Chainz would have also been a very relevant answer. His style is loud, unique, and expensive as hell. Of course, he probably doesn't pay to wear Gucci and Supreme, but it's still an aspect of his style that's not accessible to all of us. But that doesn't mean we can't appreciate and draw inspiration from it.</p>
<p>He's known for wearing (at least) two chains at (almost) all times. One chain symbolizes the man he is; the other symbolizes the man he aspires to be. His style involves loud bombers, headbands, sunglasses, and jewelry.</p>
<p>He's the host of Vice's Most Expensivest (GQ's Most Expensivest Shit), where he reviews food, weed, clothing, and everything else that might be expensive.</p>

I'm an attorney, so I wanted a classic business suit that still looked good in a modern context. Black Lapel in NYC makes MTM suits starting at $500, at better quality than any cheaper MTM options. So, after a ton of research, I thought they'd be a good option. Note that I live in a suburb of NYC and got measured in person; I would generally not recommend online-only MTM.</p>
<p>Note that this is a relatively early review, after only three wears -- there will be some interesting things to say about how it holds up over the next decade, but I think this review is pretty useful now, so here it is</p>

<h1 id="quickfacts">Quick Facts</h1>
<p><strong>Material</strong>: Super 110s wool. The Black Lapel Website does not specify a mill. Edit: The wool is from a Filarte mill near Black Lapel's Chinese manufacturing location.</p>
<p><strong>Lining</strong>: Bemberg</p>
<p><strong>Buttons</strong>: Bull Horn</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong>: Solid Charcoal</p>
<p><strong>Trousers</strong>: Belt Loops, suspender buttons (because why not), no cuff.</p>
<p><strong>Other Suit Features</strong>: Notch lapel, single breasted, half canvassed, pick stitching, functional buttonholes. Generally pretty similar to SuitSupply, Spier and Mackay.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: $500. ($25 off with referral -- <a href="https://blacklapel.com/refer-a-friend-coupon-code/8bfd0073dca3ca874df4bb0d9a7bc34e922da3af6880b22a15b2195cdeda4ba5">referral link</a>. Also -- referrals seem to work on all of their items, not just suits.)</p>
<p>Suits come with a garment bag.</p>
<h1 id="customizationoptions">Customization Options</h1>
<p>Suits come in two lines: mainline black lapel (features as described in this review) and the Savoy line, with nicer fabrics (E. Thomas, Guabello &amp; Vitale Barberis), full canvassing (or some unstructured options), milanese buttonholes, and split back trousers.</p>
<p>For each suit, you can customize the following:x</p>
<p><strong>Buttons.</strong> You can choose a one, two, or three button suit. I believe they have three-roll-two available as well, but you might need to ask in person / email support. I chose two. It appears that tuxedos only come in one button -- that's a good thing, you don't want a two button tux.</p>
<p><strong>Single or Double Breasted</strong>. I chose single.</p>
<p><strong>Lapel Type</strong>. Notch, Peak, Slim Notch, Slim Peak on this model. Tuxedos come in peak, slim peak, or shawl. Again, these are appropriate options -- you don't want a lounge suit with a shawl lapel or a tuxedo with a notch lapel.</p>
<p><strong>Vents</strong>. Lounge suits come in single or double; tuxedos come in no vent or double. I like double, as I use my pants pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Jacket Pockets</strong>. All jackets come with straight or slanted piped as an option; lounge suits add patch pockets and straight or slanted flap pockets. Since I wanted a classic business suit, I went with straight flaps. Lounge suits can come with ticket pockets; I went without, as I'm shorter, and didn't want to interrupt the vertical space on my right breast.</p>
<p><strong>Lining Color and Pattern</strong>. Most of their lining options are solid, although they have four paisley patterns available. I went with their Royal Purple. I'd recommend looking yourself if interested.</p>
<p><strong>Pleats</strong>. They offer no pleats, single, and double. I went with none.</p>
<p><strong>Cuffs</strong>. Option on business suits; I chose to go without.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Trousers</strong>. You get a slight discount here -- they come in at $140. You can get different types -- if you want to experiment with high waisted trousers but keep a low-waisted pair for most cases, that's an option. However, for some reason, I don't see this option for the tuxedo I'm looking at.</p>
<p><strong>Waistcoat</strong>. They offer an optional waistcoat for $100 (or 20% of the suit price, it seems, for more expensive suits). I did not get one.</p>
<p><strong>Pick Stitching</strong>. They've considered getting rid of this option -- you want pick stitching. Not an option on tuxedos.</p>
<p><strong>Accent Stitching</strong> on the bouttonneire and/or last sleeve buttonhole. Matches inner lining. I didn't go for this; it's kind of just there to &quot;prove&quot; that you have a custom suit, but I'd rather let the suit speak for itself.</p>
<p><strong>Rear Pockets</strong>. Two, zero, left, or right.</p>
<p><strong>Belt Loops</strong>. Yes, no, or no with side tabs. Suspender buttons or no. Side tabs on regular suits are buttoned; on the savoy line, they have a metal slidey deal that I prefer. I went with belt loops and suspender buttons, although it would be kind of silly to wear suspenders if your pants have belt loops -- side tabs + suspender buttons are probably a better option, but I wanted to play it safe and go with something standard/boring here.</p>
<p><strong>Rise</strong>. This is really a measurement, so it's not listed with the customizations on the website, but it ties into the above customization, so I just wanted to point out that it was an option.</p>
<p><strong>Monogramming</strong>. Again, I'd rather let the suit speak for itself; I find monogramming to be in somewhat poor taste.</p>
<p>Overall, these are some great options.</p>
<p>Note that button stance is not a customizable thing; it is tied to jacket length.</p>
<p>Their measurements account for shoulder angles. Their armholes are a little higher and narrower than most off-the-rack suits, which is good.</p>
<h1 id="fitexperience">Fit Experience</h1>
<p>This is a separate category because it reflects the reasons I went with Black Lapel over SuitSupply or Spier and Mackay. I couldn't try a Spier and Mackay suit on, and SuitSupply fit... Okay, but it needed a bit of tailoring, at least the sleeves and hem, so the full MTM experience at Black Lapel didn't really cost much more. The only other downside is, apparently, the material, but Black Lapel's material feels good enough to me, so I wasn't too concerned about the unnamed mill. Note that they offer free remakes and refunds, as well as a $75 tailoring credit for smaller changes (although we never discussed tailoring costs, so I don't think the $75 number is a big deal -- especially because they don't want you to return the suit).</p>
<p>The showroom is nice, but the salesmen are a little more  salesmanny and a little less tailorish than I'd like. They took all the measurements they'd need for suits, shirts, and whatever else at the first fitting.</p>
<p>The first suit arrived at my house in a very small box. I hung it up, and the wrinkling wasn't a problem -- wool tends to bounce back pretty well. It came with a garment bag, but no hanger.</p>
<p>The fit on that suit was... way off. Well, the trousers were pretty good -- they only needed minor tweaks -- but the jacket button stance (which is apparently tied to the length) was too high; this apparently threw off the entire fit, but there was no way to test it, so the jacket kinda just needed a full remake. It took me a while to make it in for my refitting, but I emailed them to let them know it would take me a while, and they took it no problem.</p>
<p>The second suit was pretty bad too, at first. They had to lower the right button (it was misaligned with the buttonholes, but the buttonholes were well-placed). The lapels were off, but all they really had to do was press them a little higher. And they took in the seat a bit. They sent it to the tailor and had it back for me within a few days. They actually re-pressed the lapels on the spot when I went in for the last fitting. (Note that I had the second suit shipped to black lapel before and after tailoring -- there wasn't really any point in getting it at home. When I left with the suit at the end, they provided a contoured plastic hanger -- not substantial, but also not wire-thin, I'd recommend getting a better hanger once you get home).</p>
<p>At the last fitting, I still wasn't thrilled; the suit was a little tight in the front/back and a little loose at the sides, which, they said, was going to be a problem unless they remade the jacket in a slimmer fit... But it was close, and, I had an interview shortly after, so I took it.</p>
<h1 id="sohowdoifeelwouldirecommendblacklapel">So, how do I feel? Would I recommend Black Lapel?</h1>
<p>I feel pretty good. The fit has grown on me -- either because the canvas is doing work, molding to my body already, or because I'm used to the suit. I still see the side-to-side/front-to-back issue as imperfect, but I'm happier with this fit than I would be with anything off the rack, even with tailoring.</p>
<p>Quality-wise, the suit is definitely there. The materials and stitching all leave me happy. And I get compliments. So I'm generally pretty happy.</p>
<p>Was it a good value at $500? Yeah. [Edit: I tried on suitsupply again, and the body length is really not even in range of reasonable tailoring. Spier and Mackay and Brooks Brothers have similar issues with their 40s length.] I might go to them for a tux one of these days, as their cheapest tux -- $600 -- is actually neck and neck with SuitSupply's cheapest off-the-rack option. Or I might go more expensive for my next suit -- NYC has a lot of great options between sample sales (I've seen full canvas for about $450, but didn't love the fit) and MTM (SS, Black Lapel's Savoy line, Imparali, Mr. Ned, Martin Greenfield... I'm too tired to list them all). I think I'll probably try them for an OCBD at some point -- again, I'm shorter, and it's harder for me to find a great fit off the rack. I'm not quite sure what I want to do next, but I'm not opposed to another Black Lapel suit. (If that doesn't sound like a glowing reveiw: I tend to be a bit of a paranoid freak about value, so if I say the value is good enough, it's going to be pretty damn hard to do better).</p>
<p>Again, the salesmen are salesmannish, but they do their jobs and don't stop until you're happy (at least, in my experience).</p>
<p>Would I recommend it? Yeah, if you're in NYC and you want relatively cheap MTM this is probably a better option than Indochino (edit: this is given horror stories I've heard about Indochino, but if you want to take a the relative risk, go ahead). Generally, it's a pretty close competitor to SuitSupply, as long as you're not in a rush. Then again, if SuitSupply or Spier and Mackay fits you very well off the rack, they're just as good on paper, and a little cheaper, so go with them. Likewise, if you are really concerned with value, thrifting, NYC sample sales, and eBay might be better options. But Black Lapel is definitely right for some people.</p>

<p>If I want to sound like an asshole, I could say... I'm on something of a mission to civilize. I want to encourage you all to look beyond the hoodies you're used to, and step your looks up a notch. Maybe not the big posters here -- you guys obviously know that Cardigans exist, and have some idea how to wear them -- but the little guys, who are here actually wondering how to step things up past a simple hoodie. But I don't want to be an asshole -- if you like hoodies, or other items, good for you. You're wrong, cardigans are the best, but good for you, enjoy what you enjoy.</p>

And I'm not, like, opposed to emotions, or anything like that. And I'm mostly fine with that... But I need a little something. So I'm going to take traditional masculinity where I can get it. I was often told that I really knew how to wear a suit -- so when a couple of friends started talking to me about lapel widths and pick stitching... I was a little rattled. Suits were something that I thought accounted for my emotional, musical-loving ass, 5'6 stature, high-pitched voice, and all. So I had to do some research. I needed to learn how to talk about suits.</p>
<p>A few years later, after digging through mfa for way more hours than I ever thought I would, I'm in a position to make the sub what I always hoped for it to be. This guide is here to make sure that, if you find yourself in a room with Tom Ford, you don't make a fool of yourself. You'll also be able to talk to your tailor like a pro.</p>
<p>One more note: This guide is insanely long. Don't binge it. I don't even know why I wrote it. Nobody paid me to do this. What's wrong with me?</p>
<h1 id="whatisasuit">What is a suit?</h1>
<p>Quick and dirty: a suit is a set of matching garments, consisting of a jacket, pants (or a skirt, or something), and optionally, a vest/waistcoat. They have to match. <strong>They have to match</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not talking about law suits. This is MFA. If you want to talk about litigation, and you're in New York, message me, I charge very reasonable rates.</p>
<h1 id="whatisntasuit">What isn't a suit?</h1>
<p>A <strong>blazer</strong> or <strong>sportcoat</strong> is not a suit. These things are similar to suit jackets, but they are <em>only</em> jackets, and <em>don't</em> come with matching pants.</p>
<p><strong>Pants</strong> are not a suit. You knew that.</p>
<p>A <strong>blazer</strong> and <strong>pants</strong> still are not a suit, because they don't match. If they do match, it's not a blazer, it's a suit jacket. If they almost match, then they don't match. If you go buy some charcoal pants from J. Crew and then you get a similar-looking charcoal blazer from Bonobos, you <strong>do not</strong> have a charcoal suit. You should <strong>never</strong> wear those two together, or you're going to look like you're trying to wear a suit, and failing. If you pair your charcoal pants with a navy blazer, you'll look fine (if not great), but you still will not be wearing a suit.</p>
<p>A <strong>bathing suit</strong> is not a suit. Or, well... it is, given a very different definition of &quot;suit,&quot; which is something like &quot;outfit,&quot; which makes sense, because a bathing suit is a one-item outfit. <strong>Jumpsuit</strong> has a similar root. That's not the definition we're using, because if it was, this article could never end.</p>
<p>A <strong>birthday suit</strong> is not a suit. Do not go to your cousin's wedding in your birthday suit. Yes, I know you got it for cheap, but your uncle will punch you in the face.</p>
<h1 id="whatskindofasuit">What's kind of a suit?</h1>
<p>Sweatsuits / <strong>Track Suits</strong> / those shitty &quot;Juicy&quot; combos girls wore in high school are not <em>not</em> suits. They meet the definition, I guess. You think of one thing when you hear the word &quot;suit,&quot; and that's what this guide is about, but if I tried to write a definition of &quot;suit&quot; that excluded these things, I'd probably end up excluding something an avant-garde fashion designer invents eight years from now that I don't want to exclude. I like vague definitions, since they make language flexible. So... Fine, these are technically suits, but I am not talking about them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I'm totally talking about <strong>tuxedos</strong> or <strong>dinner suits</strong>. I'm going to try to get into <strong>morning dress</strong> or <strong>white tie</strong> with tails and stuff too, although I've never been invited to a monarch's birthday party... But, let me put it this way: cashmere is a type of wool, but if you have cashmere, you don't use the word wool. A tuxedo is a type of suit, but you won't call it that most of the time. And the reason is... Tuxedos and &quot;<strong>lounge suits</strong>&quot; (or &quot;regular&quot; suits, or, if you they're dark colors, &quot;<strong>business suits</strong>&quot;) are used for <em>completely different</em> reasons. A lot of people don't realize this, so let me dig in.</p>
<p>Tuxedos are for <strong>parties</strong>. &quot;Lounge suits&quot; are, confusingly, for <strong>serious business</strong>. A lounge suit is <em>supposed</em> to be a little boring. It's supposed to make you look put together, the way you want your accountant to look for the five minutes you meet with him -- and then you go home, and think, &quot;that guy really has my money safe.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FOk4bCAQhc">Don't wear a tux to a business meeting</a>. And as common as it is, it's a little funny to wear a lounge suit to a wedding -- particularly if the invite says &quot;<strong>black tie</strong>,&quot; which basically means &quot;your suit should be a tuxedo.&quot; &quot;<strong>Black tie optional</strong>&quot; is what most people see when they read the words &quot;black tie.&quot; And I mean, that makes sense, because a lot of people can't afford to own both tuxes and lounge suits, and a lot of people need lounge suits. But the effect of all this is, when you see a tux, you think, <em>damn, now that guy came to party</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://smhttp-ssl-39255.nexcesscdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tom-Ford-very-well-dressed.-Maybe-the-trousers-are-a-bit-tight-otherwise-perfect-except-for-the-cap-toe-on-the-patent-leather-shoes.--450x624.jpg"><strong>full evening dress</strong></a> -- that is, <strong>white tie</strong> -- and <strong>morning dress</strong> are not just party clothing, but attire that is really proper to a very particular type of event. If you wear white tie to a black tie event, you're going to look silly -- you're going to look like a stuffy old British butler. But if you get invited to a white tie event, or an event whose invitation demands morning dress, you'd best follow the rules. There are also <strong>stroller suits</strong>, which are kind of morning suits, but less formal, but still more formal than a lounge suit. White tie is generally reserved for royal events, balls, and other fancy events. Some musicians below report that they've had to wear white tie for their roles in certain events. Morning dress is also often used for royal events, but may also be used for daytime weddings and the like. Both are more common in Europe than the US.</p>
<h1 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h1>
<p>A typical suit is composed of two matching pieces -- a <strong>jacket</strong> and pants. Sometimes, it'll include a matching <strong>vest</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>suit jacket</strong> is typically a long-sleeved jacket with a buttoned front. The buttons start way down, and you don't really have a neckline -- you have a deep v-shape leading to the first button somewhere around your navel (see <strong>button stance</strong> for details about where that ends). Now, you know how there's a folded-over padded sort of thing along the v-shape? Those are the <strong>lapels</strong>. Look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lapels&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">this shit</a>. Those things. I'm going to use the word &quot;lapels&quot; a lot, so make sure you understand what I just half-explained. In white tie, your jacket will be a <strong>tailcoat</strong>. In Morning Dress, your jacket will be a <strong>morning coat</strong>. Those are cut differently, with the tailcoat having... &quot;<a href="https://andrewsandpygott.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/morning-coat-back.jpg"><strong>tails</strong></a>.&quot;</p>
<p>A single breasted jacket (I'll explain what that means later) might have one, two, or three buttons... don't have more than three. Sometimes, you'll see a &quot;<strong>three roll two</strong>,&quot; which means &quot;three buttons, but the top one is on the bottom of the lapel, right around where it rolls.&quot; This is actually not nearly as weird as it sounds. The button isn't supposed to be buttoned, but it's a detail that, for some arbitrary reason, suit nerds like. While we're talking about it, suit nerds <em>love</em> talking about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/klKoR8D.jpg"><strong>the lapel roll</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The lapel should have what looks like a buttonhole in it meant for boutonnieres (those flowery things). Cheap suits might skip that hole, or include it but not even bother making it functional. Nice, handmade suits might have a <a href="https://imgur.com/wnKYRz8"><strong>Milanese button hole</strong></a>, which involves a few hours of hand-sweing... Yes, for just the buttonhole. Sounds wasteful, huh?</p>
<p>The jacket also often has a few pockets, and they're mostly for show. You'll almost certainly have a left breast pocket on the exterior for show or for pocket squares. You're also likely to have an interior pocket or two -- I usually see one on the left side. These are useful for a small item like a slim wallet or passport or kippah (or yarmulke, for you Yiddish folks). As for side pockets: &quot;<strong>Flap pockets</strong>&quot; are the most common thing you'll see -- they're the flaps on the sides of suits, and the pockets under them. They're formal and standard. &quot;<strong>Patch Pockets&quot;</strong> are just kind of sewn on top, and look casual. &quot;<strong>Jetted Pockets</strong>&quot; are sleek little slits in the side -- those are generally good for tuxes. A &quot;<strong>ticket pocket</strong>&quot; is a funny little detail like the 3-roll-2 thing above -- it's an extra pocket above your right pocket, which, once upon a time, was used just for train tickets. Yeah, I don't get it either.</p>
<p>There might be &quot;<strong>vents</strong>&quot; in the back of the jacket that might help you move more freely without shoving the jacket around. Zero, one, or two vents are all reasonable. I'll let you pick what you like. Center vents are historically related to horseback riding, so they're not appropriate for eveningwear.</p>
<p>Your suit has a shoulder that might or might not be padded. I'll talk about that with construction.</p>
<p>And your suit's sleeves have <strong>cuffs</strong>. Hopefully these cuffs have buttons on them. Those buttons might just be for show, or they might be functional (&quot;<strong>surgeon's cuff</strong>&quot;). If you're going to get a cheap suit, it's actually better if they aren't functional, because that makes your sleeve length easier (cheaper) to tailor. If you get an expensive suit, functional cuffs are a good idea. Some people like a contrasting buttonhole on one of the buttons... But I don't. Eh. It's a flashy detail. The buttons might be super close or not even touch.&quot;<strong>Kissing</strong>&quot; buttons barely touch. Those are good, because they vaguely imply handwork. &quot;<strong>Stacked</strong>&quot; buttons are practically on top of one another.</p>
<p><strong>Pants</strong> or <strong>trousers</strong> or <strong>slacks</strong> or <strong>suit pants</strong> are... You know, they're the things you put on your legs. If you're not Thom Browne, they're going to be long pants. They are made of matching materials, in matching colors, in matching weaves, to the suit jackets they are paired with.</p>
<p>How do you get these pants to stay up? Either a <strong>belt</strong>, <strong>side adjusters</strong>, or <strong>suspenders</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the trousers you've seen have <strong>belt loops</strong> for a belt. But belts add a little bulk, and they cost money, and a lot of people think: &quot;eh. I don't need that shit.&quot; And you don't! You don't really need anything, but at the very least, it's good to have <strong>side adjusters</strong>, which might be buttons or metal slidey things on the sides of the waist that help you tighten them up after they're already on. Or, you can have little buttons inside that connect to <strong>suspenders</strong> or <strong>braces</strong> -- those are great, but <strong>shouldn't be seen</strong> -- wear a jacket or sweater or something on top of them.</p>
<p>Trousers also have a fly, usually with a zipper and either a button or a slidey thing (or both). Hopefully, some part of the closure is off-center, which helps everything stay in put because... idk, torque something something. There's a word for this. What's the word?</p>
<p>The ankle part of your trousers will either be <strong>cuffed</strong> or not. &quot;Cuffed&quot; here means that the bottom is folded up, but not the way you roll up your jeans -- no, it's folded up by the tailor, and since your pants are tailored to your length, it looks intentional. This comes down to personal preference.</p>
<p>I'd prefer you didn't wear one, but if you must... A <strong>vest</strong> or <strong>waistcoat</strong> has a front facing made of your suit's body/shell material, and a back facing that is probably made of the same thing as the lining, I think, I don't really know. Nobody's ever going to see that rear facing, but if it's wool, you'll melt. Waistcoats are required in, and have special rules in, White Tie and Morning Dress.</p>
<h1 id="materials">Materials</h1>
<p>So, again, a suit has a <strong>body</strong> (or <strong>shell</strong>) material, some kind of <strong>canvas</strong> or something, and (usually) <strong>lining</strong>. A tuxedo will have a separate material for its lapel facings and stripe. We're going to talk about the canvas in construction, but essentially, it's supposed to be made of horsehair.</p>
<p>The <strong>bodies</strong> or <strong>shells</strong> of most decent suits are made of <strong>worsted wool</strong>. Wool might include <strong>mohair</strong> or <strong>cashmere</strong> or <strong>vicuna</strong>, but if it does, you'll know it. What the fuck does <strong>worsted</strong> mean? Well, a lot of things -- it's twisted and treated and some such... but the most tangible definition is... It's the suit stuff. You know. The kind of wool they make suits out of. Yeah. That stuff. Specifically, the worsting process involves treating and twisting the wool so that it's kind of... less fluffy, if that makes sense. You might describe it as &quot;hard,&quot; which... you know it's not hard, but it's harder than woolen. <strong>Woolen</strong> refers to the softer type of wool yarn.</p>
<p>Why wool? Wool is expensive. Why don't we use something cheaper, like cotton or polyester? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/7hqusm/materials_talk_part_2_properties_of_wool_the/">Wool is fucking great</a>. I love wool. Guys, guys, guys. Wooooool. It's warm, but breathable. It's wrinkle-resistant. It handles water well, but repels odors by magically destroying germs, even though nobody asked it to. It's durable enough to justify its cost at all tiers. And it's easy to care for. You almost never <em>need</em> to take wool to the dry cleaner, unless it gets stained or really stinks. You might clean denim more often than you do wool. Hey, u/materialsnerd, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/7hqusm/materials_talk_part_2_properties_of_wool_the/">I'm linking to your thread again.</a></p>
<p>You will often see a &quot;<strong>super number</strong>&quot; in a suit's description, such as 120s or 150s. &quot;Super&quot; is an old marketing term that described really good wool. All you need to know now is: 100s is thick (good for winter), 150s is <strong>fine</strong> (thin, good for summer). Anything finer than 150s is generally not recommended, since it will wear very quickly and feel flimsy. Such fine fabrics are generally very expensive. Everything from 100s-150s is within standard range, but ~120s is a good weight for a versatile, affordable, quality suit that will last a long time.</p>
<p>The standard suit weave is <strong>twill</strong>, but you're also going to want to know about <strong>flannel</strong>, <strong>tweed</strong>, <strong>herringbone</strong>, <strong>sharkskin</strong>, <strong>birdseye</strong>, <strong>fallie</strong>, and seersucker... some of which are variants on twill. <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/custom-suit-fabrics-weaves-types-of-suit-fabric-weaves/">Real Men Real Style</a> has a very handy guide on this.</p>
<p><strong>Tweed</strong> is an inherently ambiguous word that refers to some kind of really great, thick, warm, rough, soft wool. After a while, you'll just know it when you see it.</p>
<p>As with everything, there are some suits made of cheap <strong>polyester</strong>. Don't buy one of those if you can avoid it. You'll bake, and smell, and look bad, and it's really not <em>too</em> hard to find a cheap wool suit.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton</strong> is also usually cheap. It doesn't handle moisture or odor well, so you'll need to get it cleaned very often. It wrinkles more than wool. It's not as breathable as wool (in case you wanna go unlined). Cotton kinda sucks in all the ways wool is amazing. Sometimes it's used in blends with linen. It can also take the form of <strong>chino</strong> or <strong>seersucker</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you'll hear people talking about a <strong>chino</strong> suit. Chino is a type of cotton fabric that you can feel if you have a pair of chinos. If you have a pair of <strong>khakis</strong>, those are chinos in an ugly color. If you have <strong>cargo pants</strong>, those are probably chinos with ugly pockets. You know what chino is now, right? , but it's not so formal -- a little wrinkly, and stuff.</p>
<p>You've also heard of <strong>seersucker</strong>, maybe -- yeah, sounds funny, right? <strong>Seersucker</strong> is a kind of crunchy cotton. Seersucker is pretty breathable and pretty wrinkly.</p>
<p><strong>Linen</strong> is amazing, but not ideal for suits. Linen wrinkles like crazy. If you look up photos of linen suits, you will see <strong>nothing but lies</strong>. That's what a linen suit looks like the moment you put it on, and then you move and it is wrinkled beyond the domain of the world's most powerful iron. That said, you might see some linen blends with cotton or silk where this downside is mitigated. Oh man, I tried a linen/silk blend unstructured double breasted blazer from Ring Jacket a couple of weeks ago, and... <em>stay focused, /<em>u/danhakimi</em>, you're on a mission</em>. The main upside of linen is that it will breathe amazingly, and you'll stay cool wearing it in the summer, and you'll fall asleep and wake up and think <em>ugh, everything should be linen</em>. it's also pretty good with odor, and generally just magical, except for the wrinkling.</p>
<p><strong>Wool blends</strong> might be a few different things. They might be a blend of wool with bad things like polyester -- avoid these if you can. They might be a blend of wool with good things, like linen or <strong>silk</strong> -- those are tricky, and unique. They might wrinkle, or they might not. Other blends exist too -- I've been seeing some linen/silk blends recently, and desperately want something like that unstructured. You'll see cotton/linen and a few other things too. And you might just see a blend of different kinds of wool, like a wool-cashmere blend. Cashmere doesn't generally last as long as other kinds of wool, but it's soft and warm and expensive, so... Go for it, if you can.</p>
<p>Finally,the body of a tux might be made of <strong>velvet</strong>. Wool is more common, it's still definitely the norm, but Velvet is a thing. Except for certain details -- we're getting to that.</p>
<p>... Okay, so that's body materials. Fuck, I write a lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/70BWLmX"><strong>Lining</strong></a> is actually optional. But usually, it's <strong>polyester</strong>,  <strong>rayon</strong>, <strong>cupro</strong> (a cotton by product that's better than cotton because cotton sucks), <strong>acetate</strong>, or <strong>silk</strong>. <strong>Bemberg</strong> is a synthetic silk that is kinda like rayon, but great.</p>
<p><strong>Unlined</strong> suits (which are sometimes but not necessarily <strong>unstructured</strong>) are awesome. They breathe nicely and feel soft. They'll be finished on the inside with the same material as the body. You can also go half lined, but I'd personally go all or nothing.</p>
<p>But the lining is sometimes nice too. It adds a little weight, structure, and insulation. It puts an extra layer between you and your suit and your body, which <em>might</em> help if you sweat a lot. Finally, it's a chance to give your suits a unique touch, especially if you want to customize them -- your lining is usually invisible, but the tiny flashes make for a very slight accent, even if you go with a funky color or loud pattern. It <em>might</em> even be cheaper to use lining, since you don't need to worry about finishing the interior in wool.</p>
<p><strong>Polyester</strong> doesn't breathe. A lot of suit makers cheap out, and even if the body is wool, they'll use polyester linings. That sucks. Polyester sucks. You'll bake in it. Or even in the winter, it isn't comfortable. It will probably last forever, though.</p>
<p>All those other lining materials I mentioned are fine. You don't really care any more, do you? I mean, there's guides out there.</p>
<p>Oh, one more note -- your <strong>buttons</strong> on a lounge suit might be <strong>plastic</strong> or <strong>horn</strong>. Better suits use horn.</p>
<p>Alright, so what's the deal with tuxes? Dinner jackets have lapels face in either <strong>grosgrain</strong> (silk) or <strong>satin</strong> (silk). The matching trousers will have a stripe going down the side made of the same material as the lapel facing. The buttons will all be faced with the same material. All of these will be <strong>the same shade of black</strong>. And <strong>you will wear a bow tie made of the same material</strong>. Remember the words &quot;<strong>they have to match</strong>?&quot; Yes. That, again.</p>
<p>A morning jacket is similar in material composition to a dinner jacket, except the wool has to use a barathea or herringbone weave. The waistcoat should be a <strong>marcella</strong> or <strong>piqué</strong>  cotton, with a matching shirt and bow tie... which each have even more rules.</p>
<h1 id="construction">Construction</h1>
<p>Alright, so the first thing suit nerds want to talk about every morning is canvas. Canvas is a magical thing in between the outer layer and inner layer of your suit. This helps give the suit its shape. A suit is supposed to provide your body with some structure -- that's especially important on flabby men like me, but still looks good on, you know, Daniel Craig. Quality horsehair canvas will mold to your body over time and fit better and look better and make you happier.</p>
<p>Cheap suits might use a &quot;<strong>fused</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>fusible</strong>&quot; canvas, which might be synthetic and connected to the suit with glue. This causes the jacket to move in a silly way -- the parts that are supposed to move together don't, or the parts that are supposed to move independently don't, or both. And when you get them dry cleaned, the glue might cause shitty bubbles. So a fused suit is cheap and not very good. (If you're between a fused wool suit and a half canvassed polyester suit, I vote wool. Wool is great. Polyester sucks.) Macy's and JCF make these as well as anybody in the $150 range.</p>
<p>Then, you have middle ground #1, which is a &quot;<strong>floating chest piece</strong>.&quot; These use a little bit of horse hair, but only in the chest. It doesn't reach the lapels, or the bottom of the jacket. These are somewhat uncommon. Some people will sell them, but advertise them as half canvassed, because they're jerks. Off the top of my head, Banana Republic sells a floating chest piece, for roughly $300 on sale.</p>
<p>Then, you have <strong>half canvassed</strong> suits. These are canvassed in the chest and lapels, which causes the lapels to roll in a cool way. That's good. SuitSupply sells these in the $400-$500 range. The parts that aren't canvased don't really need much shape anyway, but they might wear a little faster than the chest, and that's not ideal. The parts that aren't canvased, in this case, are generally fused, which sucks.</p>
<p>The top tier here would be <strong>full canvas</strong> (aka <strong>canvassed</strong> by elitists who view everything as either fused or canvased). That is the whole body (not including the arms or pants). This will last longer, and look marginally better, but cost more. Up to you if you want to splurge. These <em>usually</em> cost more than $500.</p>
<p>Finally, off to the side, you have <strong>unstructured</strong> suits with no canvas or padding (or very little). They are often also unlined, which means the jacket is really just shell. These are, as you might have guessed, less structured and more flowy. They're lighter and more breathable (obviously, since you got rid of layers). They're on the casual side, but not necessarily too casual. They feel great. Ugh.</p>
<p>Shoulders often have some amount of <strong>padding</strong>. Unstructured suits often have none. Italian-style suits have little. British-style suits have a lot. A formal suit should at least have some. This relates to preference, but also to other details, and whether you want a cohesive suit.</p>
<p><strong>Pick stitching</strong> is very subtle but visible stitching you can see around the outer edge of your lapels. It signifies that the lapels were hand-padded. You want this. You might think it looks funny, but you definitely want it.</p>
<p>I forget the word for it, but nice handmade trousers will have a little corner thing at the sides which... I think helps keep the pants flexible? Somebody remind me what this is called and what it's for.</p>
<p>You might have noticed a pattern by now. A lot of details are thought to be &quot;better&quot; because they have to be made by hand. Spending four hours on one button hole is silly. So when you see a button hole that was stitched by hand for four hours, you know that <em>somebody</em> has <em>waaaay</em> too much money. You want to look like you have way too much money... and you know how to use it on things that fancy people like. That is a good thing.</p>
<h1 id="suitstyles">Suit Styles.</h1>
<p>A suit can come in one of three lapel styles, single or double breasted, and as a <strong>lounge suit</strong>, <strong>dinner suit</strong> (<strong>evening dress</strong>), <strong>dress suit</strong> (<strong>full evening dress</strong>), or <strong>morning suit</strong>, or a <strong>stroller suit</strong>.</p>
<p>Lapels can be <strong>notch lapels</strong>, <strong>peak lapels</strong>, or <strong>shawl lapels</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/notch_lapel_v3.png"><strong>Notch lapels</strong></a> have a sort of square notch cut out near your neck. This is standard for a business suit.</p>
<p><a href="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/peak_lapel_v3.png"><strong>Peak lapels</strong></a> are a little more interesting. The bottom side sticks up and out, sharply. They look very different at different lapel widths.</p>
<p><a href="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shawl_lapel_v4.png"><strong>Shawl lapels</strong></a> are funny -- they just curve straight up and down and around. These are strictly for tuxedos -- don't get a business suit with one of these. You should consider how much <a href="http://www.bondsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Shawl-Collar-Belly.jpg"><strong>belly</strong></a> your shawl lapel has. Ideally, you want a little belly -- a slight curve -- as opposed to none -- a straight line. A large belly strikes me as an old style, but I'm not sure how true that is.</p>
<p>There are a few other kinds, like <a href="http://dieworkwear.com/post/4209787375/the-tautz-lapel">Tautz</a> lapels, which nobody will expect you to know about. Those are kind of like peaks, except they point to the side.</p>
<p>You can also talk about the <strong>gorge</strong> of the notch or opening in your lapels. Higher gorges are more modern, lower and larger gorges have a classic feature to it.</p>
<p><strong>Lapel width</strong> is very important -- I'll talk about that further down.</p>
<p>A jacket can be <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/10-suit-jacket-details/"><strong>single breasted</strong> or <strong>double breasted</strong></a>. If you hear &quot;<strong>1.5 breasted</strong>,&quot; that's a particular type of double breasted jacket.</p>
<p>Confusingly, <strong>single breasted</strong> jackets have two breasts. The majority of jackets you see out there are single breasted. The defining characteristic is that there is one vertical row of buttons (or one button) that shows up at the edge of the right breast for men, or the left breast for women (particularly wealthy women from back in the day when your servants buttoned your jacket while facing you). This creates a very small overlap between the breasts.</p>
<p><strong>Double breasted</strong>, by contrast, refers to two vertical rows of buttons, and a large overlap. Recently, some companies have been using &quot;<strong>1.5 breasted</strong>&quot; as a corny marketing term for a double breasted jacket where the overlap is not that large, and the vertical rows of buttons are closer. Apparently, the advantage of this is that it looks better unbuttoned... but you don't buy a double breasted suit to wear unbuttoned.</p>
<p>Most suits you've ever seen are <strong>lounge suits</strong> or, if they're in dark colors, <strong>business suits</strong>. Single breasted lounge suits should generally come with notch lapels, but peak lapels aren't wrong, just a little silly. Double breasted lounge suits usually have peak lapels, which, with pinstripes, will place you in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129809065@N06/36932700674/in/album-72157686091167302/">full 1940s gangster</a> territory. Generally, for a single breasted lounge suit, you want two buttons, or a three roll two. Maybe three if you're tall and old-fashioned.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner suits</strong> or <strong>tuxedos</strong> (<strong>eveningwear</strong>) are... Well, I've been talking about them for forever by now, so you know. They're the party suits. Don't wear them before 6pm or else they'll transform into gremlins. They shouldn't have notch lapels, less because it's wrong, and more because lounge suits have notch lapels, and you don't want to look like a boring accountant, you want to look like you came to party. Peak or shawl. Again, they can be single or double breasted, but a double breasted tuxedo is a real oddity. Generally, you want a one button tuxedo. You want to wear a tuxedo shirt with this, which is different from a regular dress shirt. Their trousers have a single stripe along the side in the same material as the lapel facing.</p>
<p>Note that &quot;<strong>black tie</strong>&quot; generally refers to a non-velvet tux in one of two specific colors: black, or <strong>midnight blue</strong>. Did I say navy? I did not. <a href="https://www.mytuxedocatalog.com/blog/tuxedos-in-movies-james-bonds-midnight-blue-tuxedo-in-skyfall/">Midnight blue</a> is darker than navy, and often shows up as darker than black in photos. The tie that the style is named after is <strong>not a necktie</strong>. You can wear a <strong>bow tie</strong>, or... well, a <strong>cravat</strong> might work, but that's a whole other discussion. Again, peak or shawl, with black lapel facings in grosgrain or satin. <strong>Creative black tie</strong> can involve crazy colors and velvet and double breasts and crazy prints and shit like that. <strong>Still no neckties</strong>.</p>
<p>Also note that a tuxedo can and must be worn with exactly one of the following: <strong>suspenders</strong> or <strong>braces</strong>, a <em>matching</em> <strong>waistcoat</strong> (in which case, you shouldn't button the button), or a <strong>cummerbund</strong> (the thick silky thing that goes around your waist but isn't a belt). <strong>Do not wear a belt with a tuxedo</strong>. Don't wear two of the above. Don't wear three of the above. Don't wear zero of the above. Don't buy a tuxedo with belt loops, it shouldn't have belt loops. If you're wearing it with a waistcoat or cummerbund, you probably want side adjusters on your trousers.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Beauchamp7.JPG"><strong>White tie</strong></a> describes a very particular type of suit (<strong>full evening dress</strong>), a weird thing with <strong>tails</strong> and way too many rules... paired with a low-cut white marcella waistcoat, and a very particular type of white shirt, and a white tie, all in a particular weave as described above. The suit should be black with peak lapels, and the lapels should again be faced in satin or grosgrain. The jacket is short in the front and cut in a particular way, whereas the tails in the back are very long. The jacket should not be buttoned, and generally cannot be buttoned. The pants might have a single or double stripe along the sides.</p>
<p>White tie should be paired with a shirt and bow tie that match the waistcoat. The shirt should have a single french cuff, and should be fastened with studs. The shoes should be patent leather opera pumps. You can optionally throw in a top hat, a cane, or white gloves. There are a thousand more rules, but this info should be enough to get you started talking about white tie.</p>
<p>A <strong>morning suit</strong> (for <strong>morning dress</strong>) is kind of like full evening dress, but crazier, and during the day. It's the one suit where your jacket and pants <em>should</em> contrast, in both color and pattern -- your pants should actually be pinstriped. The jacket is longer in the back, but unlike a white tie jacket, is cut smoothly, so that some of the length is evident from the front, and so that the back doesn't form &quot;tails.&quot; The full length in the back should be about knee-length. The lapels are still peak, and is usually some kind of gray or black. The waistcoat should be made of the same material, but in a different color.</p>
<p>A <strong>stroller</strong> suit is the informal equivalent of a morning suit, although still more formal than a lounge suit. I have no idea what makes it different from a morning suit, and honestly, if you care, you have too much time on your hands.</p>
<h1 id="measurementsworththinkingabout">Measurements worth thinking about</h1>
<p>Suits come in <strong>off the rack</strong> (or <strong>off the peg</strong>, or <strong>ready to wear</strong> -- <strong>otr</strong> or <strong>rtw)</strong>, <strong>made to measure</strong> (or <strong>mtm</strong>), and <strong>bespoke</strong>. Off the rack suits come in fixed sizes. Made to measure involves a lot of measurements that are then sent abroad for cheap labor on a pretty good suit with some amount of personal customization. Bespoke involves multiple rounds of measurement and fitting over months with an amazing local tailor who will make you an insanely good suit that fits perfectly and can be customized however you want.</p>
<p>The primary size for any suit jacket is defined by <strong>chest</strong> and <strong>length</strong>. But the primary length &quot;measurement&quot; is just a choice between <strong>regular</strong>, <strong>long</strong>, and <strong>short</strong>. This length covers both the body and sleeve. <strong>Sleeves</strong> are pretty easy to tailor, so don't even trip about those, plan on getting them tailored. Functioning buttonholes are actually a little bit harder to tailor, but still not that hard.</p>
<p><strong>Body length</strong> is a little trickier, since it also relates to <strong>button stance</strong>. Button stance is where the top button on the jacket sits on your body. I typically wear a 40s. If I got a 40L and shortened the sleeves and shortened the body, I'd still have an issue, in that the buttons would be waaaay down there. This can theoretically be tailored, but don't plan on it -- your tailor would have to sew over and redo buttonholes, shift the lapels, maybe move pockets, and do a bunch of other stuff you don't want done, even if your tailor is willing to try. Just get a jacket with a good button stance, and good body length.</p>
<p><strong>Button Stance</strong> itself is important. It generally refers to the position of the top button that you're supposed to use, or the &quot;buttoning point.&quot; For example, it would refer to the second button on a 3-roll-2 jacket. It should usually be around your natural waist, but shifting it up or down might be good if you want to shift proportions: a higher stance shortens your torso and lengthens your legs, and a lower stance lengthens your torso and shortens your legs. Some people also use the term &quot;button stance&quot; to refer to the distance between buttons, which is more interesting in double breasted jackets than single breasted ones.</p>
<p>The <strong>shoulder</strong> fit is also very important. You won't see it reflected in sizing, and it's usually kept in some proportion to your chest, so if your chest and shoulders are not standard proportions, you might have a slight issue with off-the-rack suits. This is <strong>very</strong> hard to tailor, so get it right the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Lapel width</strong> is a different issue -- not really so much about fit, but proportion, and style. They're measured at the widest point. Skinny lapels are out -- they were a brief modern style. A classic suit as a decent sized lapel. Your tie width (at the widest point) should, in theory, match your lapel width. Note that this really transforms some of the above lapel styles. Slim peak versus super wide peak lapels are very different. Some shawl lapels go deep, and others are sleeker and cleaner (I like the latter, but the former is more classic).</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning <strong>arm holes</strong>. Not eye holes, no, arm holes. The hole at your shoulder that goes to your arm. You don't want them to be baggy. Off the rack, and even made to measure, these are going to have a little give, and go a little lower than your actual armpit. Off the rack, they have to fit everybody. MTM, they're still following a pattern and this is just a detail they won't handle. Bespoke tailors, on the other hand, can give you high, narrow arm holes, which will move beautifully with your body and help keep your posture and just make everything better. Ugh, I want a bespoke suit.</p>
<p>The arm hole's seam is called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Juf2oINMI"><strong>sleeve head</strong></a>. Sven explains sleeve heads better in that video than I can in text. Again, these are something you'll worry about more when you get into customizing a suit, or buying unstructured suits, but some off-the-rack bands do interesting things with shoulder padding and structure, so even if you're just going to SuitSupply, it's worth understanding.</p>
<p>Now, for <strong>pants</strong>, we're worrying about <strong>waist</strong>, <strong>inseam</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, and <strong>rise</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're buying off the rack, <strong>waist</strong> is the first number. I generally wear a 32/30, which means a 32 waist. You know what pant waists are. (Your suit also exists at your waist, so this measurement is relevant to a good suit fit, but since they're sized by the chest, that relates more to your fit, off the rack).</p>
<p>The second number is <strong>inseam</strong>, which is kind of code for length. But it's the length of the seam on the inside -- IE, from your crotch down to your ankles. Where on your angles? That depends.</p>
<p>Do you want your pants <strong>cropped</strong>, or too short to meet your shoes when standing? That's pretty casual, I wouldn't recommend it. If you do it, you want your pants pretty slim. You can have <strong>no break</strong>, which means they just barely touch your shoes, or don't, but end right there, you know? That's a modern/young look -- perhaps too much so. A <strong>slight break</strong>, where the pants hit your shoes a little, is still pretty modern and young without looking bad to the partners at your firm. A <strong>medium break</strong> hits your shoes a little more, and starts to fold a bit, and is good, classic, and perfect for the partner, unless he's an old man, in which case he might try a <strong>full break</strong>, which really folds at the ankles and over the shoes. Pants with a full break should not be slim.</p>
<p>Note that inseam and break are probably the easiest things in the world to tailor. So again, don't sweat it when buying. A lot of brands sell pant legs unfinished, so you can handle this (and also decide whether you want to cuff the leg or not).</p>
<p>So, if the inseam is the length under the crotch, what's the length from waist to crotch? For some reason, that's called the <strong>rise</strong>. A lower-medium rise is pretty standard these days, and sits in the same place as most of your pants sit, above your hips. A high rise sits at your &quot;natural waist,&quot; above your belly button, and is pretty classic, believe it or not. If you want to be talked into a high rise, go read <a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/">https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Off the rack suits <em>sometimes</em> have separate sizes for jackets and pants, but <em>sometimes</em> just tell you the jacket size and assume what your pants size would be. They call the difference between these sizes your &quot;<strong>drop</strong>.&quot; If you have an unusually large or small drop, that really sucks. Either go for the brands that will sell you separate sizes, or go made to measure.</p>
<p>Finally, we can talk about <strong>fit</strong>. You don't want your suit too <strong>skinny</strong>. You're not buying it to go to hipster bars in Brooklyn. So you can go <strong>slim</strong> and modern, or <strong>regular</strong> and classic. Or <strong>relaxed</strong>. If you're buying off the rack, you want to use this to try to match your body and get something that actually fits well. If you're going MTM or bespoke, you know your suit is going to fit you, so you want to pick based on style -- not whether it fits, but <em>how</em> it fits. Do you want it to hang and flow a little more? Do you want to look tight and put together? I mean, you will look put together either way, but... You know, talk to your tailor, see where you want to land.</p>
<h1 id="alrightiknoweverythingnowwheredoibuyone">Alright, I know everything now, where do I buy one?</h1>
<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/844jel/your_favorite_for_the_price_suits/">our favorites</a> at various price points, or Styleforum's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y32yqkSU5_ZnVO7ub_B5Y6J9E_izu6qD6nwdzw7V1HU/edit#gid=1990531564">hierarchical list by quality</a>.

<p>I think one of the more useful things we do in this subreddit is help people find the right words to describe things. So I decided now would be a good time to write a guide explaining what exactly a loafer is, and then explaining the categories of loafers. I'm going to explain this in simple terms, partly because I don't know all the technical terms that might be relevant here... But if anybody wants to contribute, I'm absolutely open to additions.</p>
<p>I'm doing this about loafers in anticipation of this weeks _/$ thread, which will probably be loafers, even though we had a very handy guide on penny loafers at different price points recently... Basically, you guys have two cheat sheets to work with, so you have no excuse to not make that thread amazing.</p>
<h1 id="whatisntaloafer">What isn't a loafer?</h1>
<p>A <strong>Moccasin</strong> is not a loafer. A moccasin has a toppish part (I guess you might call it a vamp), and then a seam connecting it to a sideish-wrap-around-the-bottomish part. That is to say, they might not have a separate sole! The sole and the side might be the same piece! Even if they do have a separate sole, it is probably soft. In no event does a Moccasin have a heel. <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/moccasin-driving-mocs-guide/">Here's some history and detail.</a> The soft sole is good for grass and forests, but bad for paved European roads. You would not wear a moccasin in a city, so you wouldn't wear it in modern business. It's a very casual shoe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I now need to touch on the way shoes are made: Shoes are generally made by stretching a piece of leather (or whatever) around a solid foot-shaped thing until it looks like it could wrap around a foot. This foot-shaped thing is called a &quot;<strong>last</strong>.&quot; Most European dress shoes are &quot;lasted&quot; from the top-down, creating a downward curve, and have a hard sole slapped on. Moccasins, however, are generally &quot;lasted&quot; from the bottom up, and then have the &quot;upper&quot; (the toppish part) slapped on. So the curvy part of a moccasin is at the bottom, and the seam usually <em>doesn't</em> curve with the contours of the foot.</p>
<p>A <strong>Driver</strong> is pretty much a moccasin that was inspired by loafers but then turned back into a moccasin ad midnight when its fairy godmother's spell wore off. They have little ball thingies on the bottom that add some grip. <a href="https://www.jackerwin.com/collections/spring-summer-2018-collection/products/parker-leather?variant=5505173192719">Jack Erwin</a> makes some. Since they're not constructed like dress shoes, and since they're super casual, you can go ahead and cheap out on these. These usually come with a vamp that is reminiscent of penny loafers or sometimes bit loafers, but again, they are not loafers.</p>
<p><strong>Slippers</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Dress Slippers</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Prince Albert Slippers</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Smoking Slippers</strong> are a sole + a solid curved upper. They do not separate that toppish part from a sideish part -- their upper is often wholecut. I fucking love these things. They have a dress shoe's sole, so I'd say they qualify as dress shoes, but you probably want to wear them casually. They can come in <a href="https://www.deltoroshoes.com/collections/mens-slippers-1/products/mens-black-velvet-slipper">velvet</a>, <a href="http://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/shoes/albert-navy-kid-suede-389-last.html">suede</a>, or <a href="https://viberg.com/collections/footwear/products/slipper-brown-reindeer?variant=46604776712">smooth leather</a>. These can be worn casually. If they're &quot;smoking slippers,&quot; or have any embroidery, they should <em>only</em> be worn casually. Plain black velvet slippers are also black tie appropriate. Hell, they can even be pulled off a few places in the middle. But, at any stage, you need to know what you're doing. They're a tricky shoe to wear -- you gotta rock it, or not wear it at all. But damn, are they sexy.</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, the word <strong>slipper</strong> is also used to describe <a href="http://www.takkens.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/6/1690m220.jpg">these cozy things</a>, but those are more moccasins than they are slippers... technically.</p>
<p>You might also call <a href="https://www.meermin.es/in_en/10149810190000ye-19-101498-black-calf-e-negro.html"><strong>chelsea boots</strong></a> slip-ons, but no, they are not loafers. Sandals and &quot;slides&quot; and stuff are also, and I hope this is obvious, not loafers.</p>
<h1 id="whatisaloafer">What is a loafer?</h1>
<p>A loafer is essentially a <strong>slip-on shoe</strong> with a <strong>moccasin-like upper</strong> (top + sides), a separate, <strong>rigid sole</strong> (leather or, in some cases, rubber), and a <strong>heel</strong>. There's always some sort of seam connecting the sides to the top (or &quot;vamp&quot; but I'll call it the top because that's probably easier to understand) -- even if it's subtle, like in <a href="https://imgur.com/BnoOOJU">these Ferragamo apron toe bit loafers</a>. If you see <em>no</em> seam along the top -- if your shoe is, for example, wholecut -- it is <strong>not a loafer</strong>, it is a slipper.</p>
<p>When I say &quot;slip-on shoe,&quot; I mean that a loafer does not have <em>functional</em> closure mechanism. No <em>functional</em> laces, buckles, straps, velcro... nothing. You just slip 'em on.</p>
<p>The loafer seems to have two different origins -- idk, I'm not a historian. One story is, some British dude named Wildsmith came up with them, as a simpler variant on other British shoes. The other is, they came from Norwegians in Aurland who saw some Native American moccasins and thought, &quot;you know, that's alright -- now let's smash that into our dress shoes and see what happens -- their toes were more moccasin-like, and thicker, so we call them &quot;moc toes.&quot; If you've heard the word &quot;<strong>weejun</strong>&quot; that's what G.H. Bass decided to call his line of these Norwegian-style shoes. You'll see the names &quot;Wildsmith&quot; and &quot;Aurland&quot; again soon. Some Belgians independently came up with their own loafers based on slippers -- I'll get into them, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Boat shoes</strong> technically <em>are</em> loafers, since they have a rigid sole with a (small) heel and a moccasin-style upper. That said, if you go around calling boat shoes loafers, you'll get slapped. Do you want to be right, and slapped, or wrong, but unslapped? Do not wear boat shoes outside of super casual scenarios. (I love me some boat shoes, though). Everything below, <em>except</em> for boat shoes, generally counts as a dress shoe.</p>
<h1 id="materials">Materials</h1>
<p>Most of the materials you might use to make any dress shoe work for a loafer too. Mostly leathers, including suede. Suede works nicely on a casual loafer, as it does on a casual anything else. You probably don't want patent leather. You might want velvet, but that'll be hard to care for. I'm not going to dig any deeper, since this applies to all shoes, and I want to keep this focused.</p>
<h1 id="construction">Construction</h1>
<p>Like all dress shoes, the soles of a loafer can be stitched or glued, and stitched is better. I won't get into details here either, since, again, you can find this info in a general shoe guide. Again these shoes are made with a <strong>last</strong>, or pretend foot thing.</p>
<p>Most dress shoes are lasted from the top-down. That is to say, imagine I take a big stretchy piece of leather and stretch it over the top of your foot. This creates a smooth downward curve. That's sleek. That's pretty dressy.</p>
<p>Loafers, however, are half-inspired by moccasins. And moccasins, as we discussed, are lasted from the bottom up, which means that their toes are not a smooth downward curve -- but lets get into that below... Many brands will refer to this as &quot;genuine moccasin construction,&quot; but remember, moccasins wouldn't have a hard sole and heel stitched on, because Native Americans weren't about that, so it's more &quot;moccasin-style lasting.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="toestyles">Toe Styles</h1>
<p>Moccasin-style lasting usually goes hand in hand with a thick moccasin-like seam, for a &quot;<strong>moc toe</strong>.&quot; Since it takes these elements for Native American style, and since the shoe isn't very sleek, it's not the most formal thing. You should probably wear these in casual looks -- like, wear them with shorts and no show socks before you wear them a suit. Generally.</p>
<p>European-style top-down lasting, on the other hand, is usually paired with an &quot;<strong>apron toe</strong>&quot; with a tiny seam for a smooth downward curve. Since it's a sleek Euoropean style, it's relatively formal. You can wear these with a suit just fine, but they'll usually look odd with shorts or jeans or no show socks.</p>
<h1 id="typesofloafers">Types of Loafers</h1>
<p><strong>Penny Loafers</strong> -- including <strong>Aurland</strong> and Wildsmith -- loafers, are loafers with a &quot;saddle,&quot; a sort of strap going across the top with a sort of diamond-shape opening near the top/middle of the strap. The story goes, Ivy League bros put a penny in that opening to remind them to call their mommies every day. Whether they did this because they were homesick, or kind, or afraid that they'd lose their inheritance, I haven't the foggiest, but one way or another, they were mamma's boys.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The strap can go all the way to the sole -- "<strong>full strap</strong>" -- or just to the seam – "<strong>half strap</strong>" or "<strong>pinch</strong>" -- or to the seam, but then with a thick roll on the seam -- "<a href="https://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s/loafers/penny-loafers/beefroll-penny-loafers.html"><strong>beefroll</strong></a>". Beefrolls are suuuuper casual -- don't wear them with a suit. A lot of American companies have gotten to making beefrolls with hand-sewn moc toes, which, even with a dress shoe sole, is especially casual. You'll see that style on a lot of drivers for that reason.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.visitflam.com/en/aurlandskoen/"><strong>"Aurland" loafer</strong></a>, since it is based directly on the moccasin, has a moc toe. This is relatively casual, which is why a lot of companies (like Rancourt above) combine it with the beefroll for a very casual "dress" shoe. Half/full straps are still relatively casual, but less so.</p><p>The <a href="https://wildsmith.com/product/wildsmith-bayswater-loafer-in-dark-walnut"><strong>Wildsmith loafer</strong></a> has an Apron toe. Again, this is a European style, so it's noticeably dressier. A lot of people here will tell you still not to wear them with suits, but you're probably fine in the real world. Some people consider getting something like this in patent leather for black tie, though, and that's wrong. You would be looking for velvet slippers or patent leather opera pumps.</p><p><strong>Tassel Loafers</strong> are, believe it or not, loafers with a sort of a tassel thingy. <a href="https://www.theshoemart.com/alden/dress/loafers/tassel-loafers">This is what I'm talking about.</a> Yeah, Alden made the OG tassel loafers, with Brooks Brothers. They continue to make great ones today. These are the youngest and arguably stupidest-looking loafers, but, confusingly, they're popular with rich old people and are considered relatively formal. This has to do with the idea that the tassel is based on laces, and laces make things more formal, even though laces here are partially inspired by the moccasin. Note, also, that the "laces" go around the side on these particular Aldens -- I'm not sure what this is called, but it is again reminiscent of the moccasin. Finally note that Alden seems to last from the top down, but their seam is thicker than some Apron toes. Some other tassel loafers may be lasted from the bottom up.</p><p><strong>Venetian Loafers</strong> don't have a tassel, or a strap, or anything. They're kinda "plain." BB/Rancourt makes <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Rancourt-Co-American-Loafers/MH00153,default,pd.html">these</a> conspicuously named American Venetian loafers. Although "plain" is almost always associated with formality, Venetian loafers are actually more casual, because of the moc toe. In case you're seeing a pattern: none of this shit makes a ton of sense. Formality is a little arbitrary.</p><p><strong>Belgian Loafers</strong> are a little different. Originally made by <a href="https://belgianshoes.com/product-category/mens/">Belgian Shoes</a>, and inspired more by slippers than by moccasins, they often have a tiny bow. They also tend to have a slightly different construction and usual last, with a small seam, but still very distinct top and side parts. <a href="https://www.baudoinandlange.com/shop">Baudoin and Lange</a> is another great brand that does custom jobs here. Since they're based on slippers, they're usually sleeker than other types of loafers. This also makes them more formal -- probably the most formal loafer by most standards. You'll notice that there's a patent leather one on B&amp;L's website, but I wouldn't recommend it for Black Tie, or at all, really. I'm not sure how these shoes are lasted -- it seems like there's a discontinuity, and a few very separate curves -- so I'm going to sleep, watch a few videos, get back here, and edit this.</p><p><strong>Bit Loafers</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Horsebit Loafers</strong> a.k.a. <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/is-it-worth-gucci-loafers/"><strong>Gucci Loafers</strong></a> a.k.a. <strong>Snaffle Loafers</strong> (call them this ONLY if you're a British cartoon character). As you can guess from one of the names, they were made by Aldo Gucci, based on, as you can probably not guess from a different name, a metal horse bit. I have no idea what a horse bit is. Anyway, they're defined by that metal thing that apparently has something to do with horses. Gucci's originally came in black with a gold bit and moc toe, but they exist with apron toes, as with the ferragamos I listed above. Even moc toe bit loafers can be formal, because that's how the elites felt like wearing them some of the time. Other companies make them these days, but Gucci really wants to be the only company that makes them, considering they pioneered the style and it helped significantly to make their brand what it is. If you want to talk about Intellectual Property... well, that's my day job, so hire me for an hour, and we can get into that. You can afford it, Mr. Gucci Loafers.</p><p>Since they're associated with Gucci, and have a shiny piece of metal in the mix, bit loafers can be ostentatious. These are the kind of things you wear when you either want to flaunt wealth or turn some heads. That said, don't try flaunting wealth with <a href="http://www.colehaan.com/mens-pinch-gotham-bit-loafer-british-tan/C22538.html?dwvar_C22538_color=British%20Tan&amp;dwvar_C22538_width=#cgid=mens_shoes_loafersdrivers&amp;start=61">Cole Haans</a>, they're really a cheap shoe (cheaply made), and snobs will know it -- if you must wear those, wear them for the latter reason, to turn heads.</p><p>Fun fact: <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/110107">the Met has a pair of Gucci bit loafers on permanent display</a>. These things are fashion history.</p><p><strong>Other Loafers</strong> include Kilted loafers, which are dumb, so I'm not going to get into them, other than to call them dumb. Come at me, kilted loafers. Some loafers have buckles, kind of like double monks. That's dumb too.  You don't need a seal mechanism for a slip-on shoe. Some have some "lacing" in a moccasin-style bow, like these <a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-loafers/string-loafer-snuff-suede-80228">Carmina String Loafers</a>. I like those. <a href="https://www.tomford.com/men/shoes/loafers/">Tom Ford</a> has gotten to making some chain loafers lately, and if Tom's doing it it ain't wrong, but these are going to be difficult to pull off -- harder than bit loafers, either. Again, <strong>boat shoes</strong> are technically loafers, with a lacing situation -- I know I said laces make a thing more formal, but boat shoes don't really count because they aren't dress shoes at all.</p><h2 id="alright-i-know-everything-now-where-do-i-buy-them">Alright, I know everything now.
