I asked him why, and apparently, his private school has a dress code that requires a &lt;em&gt;buttoned shirt&lt;/em&gt;. This is a stupid dress code. Not because all dress codes are inherently bad, but because they picked the wrong words for the policy. They clearly intended to limit students to &lt;em&gt;collared&lt;/em&gt; shirts, which are a clear category ranging from smart casual up. A henley is just as casual as a tee shirt, so all this dress code accomplishes is that it annoys students and their parents. (Alternatively, they could have meant to limit the dress code to &lt;em&gt;woven&lt;/em&gt; shirts, but knit collared shirts are cool and I'm going to talk about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a guy trying to dress better, or a school principal trying to design a better dress code, this guide is for you! I'm going to go through a variety of collar styles, fabrics, weaves, and other details, teaching you all sorts of vocabulary -- both the kind you absolutely need to know, and the kind you don't really want to know at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to read through this guide start to finish in one sitting. You might want to look for the sections you think look interesting, or bookmark the article and use it as a quick reference. On the other hand, if you're trying to do research for made to measure or bespoke shirting, skimming the whole article and stopping at the parts that pique your interest might be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="whatisnotacollaredshirt"&gt;What is not a collared shirt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;tee shirt&lt;/strong&gt; is not a collared shirt. I mean, technically, you can argue that the little band at the top of the tee shirt is a collar, but you shouldn't argue that, and nobody who says &amp;quot;collared shirt&amp;quot; means to include a tee shirt. Tee shirts can have crew necks, v necks, or scoop necks. Collared shirts are typically also made from different fabrics, although there are corner cases here I'd rather not get into until later. Tee shirts are generally made from &lt;strong&gt;jersey&lt;/strong&gt;, a knit fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;henley&lt;/strong&gt; is not a collared shirt. A henley is just a crew neck tee shirt with a few buttons going down from the neck, but not all the way down. It is similar to a popover, except a popover has a collar, and a popover usually uses similar fabric to a collared shirt, whereas a henley is usually still jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;sweatshirt&lt;/strong&gt; is not a collared shirt. It's similar a crew neck tee or sweater, except with a very particular fabric, which you will probably never see on any shirt with a collar. A &lt;strong&gt;hoodie&lt;/strong&gt; also isn't a collared shirt. No, a hood isn't a collar, and the fabric is still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;sweater&lt;/strong&gt; is not a collared shirt... Except, well, knit shirts exist, and the distinction might get hazy at some remote point. There are sweaters with a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;shawl collar&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; but... That's normally diferent from the shawl collar you'd see on even a knit shirt. A shawl collar pullover might use toggles. The shawl collar on a cardigan is really more like a lapel than a collar. Also, both of these are much thicker than any knit shirt would be. So yeah, a sweater is not a collared shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="whatiskindofacollaredshirt"&gt;What is kind of a collared shirt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overshirt, also known as a shirt jacket, to the extent that it is a shirt, is a collared shirt. But it's kind of outerwear. Let's not talk too much about overshirts, other than to remind ourselves that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, some sweaters have collars. And you can, if you want to start arguing about definitions, call a sweater a shirt. But I won't. So a sweater is not a collared shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirts with Band, Grandad, Nehru, and Mandarin collars are, as far as I'm concerned, collared shirts, simply with minimal collars. I'll discuss them more in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/semi-spread-open.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to Talk About Collared Shirts"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="howtotalkaboutshirtcollars"&gt;How to talk about shirt collars.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id="collarconstruction"&gt;Collar Construction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collar is generally a separate piece sewn onto a shirt. This is not always the case -- see &lt;strong&gt;One Piece Collar&lt;/strong&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often a &lt;strong&gt;collar band&lt;/strong&gt; on a collared shirt. This is generally a band that goes around the underside of the collar that helps it stand up. The collar band often covers the seam where the collar is attached to the shirt. Take a look at some of your collared shirts, under the collar, and you'll very likely see a strip of fabric there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;one piece collar&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of collar that is not stitched on, but is actually a single piece with the shirt, woven or knit continuously, and does not use a collar band. This allows it to create a smooth roll the whole way through. Most of the other collar styles here can be one-piece collars, but these are relatively rare, as it is hard to sew a shirt together like this, and also hard to make a fabric and fusible combination that rolls just right. I believe that the term &lt;strong&gt;capri collar&lt;/strong&gt; also refers to a one piece collar, but this is not very clear from my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusible&lt;/strong&gt;  or &lt;strong&gt;fusing&lt;/strong&gt; is... Uh, it's confusing. Essentially, the collar itself is usually two layers of fabric, and there's usually some kind of gluey &amp;quot;fusible&amp;quot; lining in between them. This helps determine how stiff the collar is, and how it rolls. Some shirts don't use any at all, which makes them extremely flexible -- since the collar's just made of regular cotton. Some very high-end shirts use a floating lining here, similar to a floating canvas in a suit, but this doesn't make much difference, and even top-end brands like &lt;a href="https://www.permanentstyle.com/2018/08/the-quality-of-100-hands-shirts.html"&gt;100 Hands&lt;/a&gt; use fusible by default. Fusible can be ironed to a collar with a hand iron or pressed by machine -- usually the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the outer layer of fabric is bigger than the inner layer -- this causes it to roll downward in a certain way. The details of &lt;strong&gt;collar roll&lt;/strong&gt; depend on the size of the collar, kind of fusible used, whether it's a button down collar, what kind of fabric we're talking about... There are a lot of factors here. As with a lapel roll in jackets, a collar roll is something menswear afficionados go &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; for. I discuss it further below around button down collars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="howtotalkaboutcollarstyles"&gt;How to talk about collar styles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took enough of these images from &lt;a href="https://propercloth.com/"&gt;Proper Cloth&lt;/a&gt; that they earn a special shout-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Spread Collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/PaxPHrd.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/U1EWdMn.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;) might what you think of when you think of a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; shirt collar. Either that, or you're thinking of the &lt;strong&gt;Semi-Spread Collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/lw000y8.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/GR3sXwU.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;), which might be a little narrower and look better without a tie. Or a &lt;strong&gt;Point Collar&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Forward Point Collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/ibPVZ2h.png"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/kMKu8BS.png"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;), which might be taller and narrower still. Consider these all in proportion to your face height and width, tie knot width, and lapel width and position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people define spread and point collars by specific proportions, but the numbers vary, and the important thing is just that you're thinking about proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, the spread and semi-spread are the most modern, and the point is the most classic. The semi-spread is best without a tie. The spread is the best with a wide tie knot. The point can look great when going for a classic vibe -- at the extreme, consider the &lt;strong&gt;spearpoint collar&lt;/strong&gt;, narrower and longer, and related to the &lt;strong&gt;tab collar&lt;/strong&gt; I'll discuss below. &lt;a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2019/03/04/an-ode-to-the-spearpoint-collar/"&gt;Ethan Wong loves the Spearpoint Collar&lt;/a&gt;. Pair it with a collar bar and vintage tie, and you'll make him proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will generally want to keep these collars pointy with &lt;strong&gt;collar stays&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above come to a point on each side, button in the middle... Let's explore what &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; a spread or point collar, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the spread and point families might be simpler and more common, a &lt;strong&gt;Button-Down Collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/nb3TI3b.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/f7tsy7l.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;) is probably your bread and butter, especially if you're not wearing ties every day. The &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;oxford cloth button down&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; is your classic &amp;quot;smart casual&amp;quot; shirt -- generic, good enough for a country club, good enough for your office, good enough to wear to a bar. Good at a tucked or untucked length. Okay with a tie. A button down collar is pretty standard on linen shirts and flannels as well. I know, I know, you want to talk about fabrics now, but all things in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm going to remind you about all that stuff we said about fusible. Remember fusible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the button-down collar has two fixed points on each side -- the top of the collar and the button point -- this is the perfect style of collar for a good collar roll. A short, cheaply made button down collar might not have an impressive collar roll. But as you start to spend more, this is one of the benefits you'll see. See: &lt;a href="https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/icon-oxford-shirt-37195830?categoryId=167205&amp;amp;seq=03&amp;amp;faceout=prod"&gt;Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt; (fine for the price, but an awful collar in person), &lt;a href="https://www.brooksbrothers.com/Non-Iron-Regent-Fit-Bengal-Stripe-Sport-Shirt/MG03266,default,pd.html?dwvar_MG03266_Color=BLUE&amp;amp;contentpos=1&amp;amp;cgid=0297"&gt;Brooks Brothers&lt;/a&gt; (the classic, but buy it on sale), &lt;a href="https://kamakurashirts.com/collections/vintage-ivy-shirts/products/wjg00523"&gt;Kamakura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/shop/shirts/oxford-shirt-white"&gt;Asket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gitmanvintage.com/products/blue-oxford-1"&gt;Gitman Vintage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a &lt;strong&gt;hidden button down collar&lt;/strong&gt; is also possible -- it'll look like a spread or point collar, but stay in place like a button down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;cutaway collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/klMV9WC.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/P0kq1Sl.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;) is similar to the full spread... but even wider, cut away from the tie. These are designed to put a tie on display -- whether you want to show off a wide knot, or something else. They don't really look great without a tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;club collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/srlJaRz.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/SHy5DAJ.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;) is like a spread collar except, instead of coming to a point, it's rounded. This is kind of an old-timey country club thing, again made for a tie. It's one of the harder ones to wear well today -- although it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Tab Collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/6bOsHA9.jpg"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/qMz8cge.jpg"&gt;closed, no tie -- for illustration purposes only&lt;/a&gt;) is a funny one. Do not wear this without a tie. That little strip of fabric you see in the second photo is the &amp;quot;tab.&amp;quot; It buttons behind your tie, and is supposed to lift it up, in a manner similar to a collar pin. It's cool if you want your tie to sit in a particular way, and you can't pull it off with just the tie, and you don't like collar pins, this is one way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/4q3x0ZL.jpg"&gt;camp collar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Cuban collar&lt;/strong&gt; is an open collar without a collar band. Instead of standing up or rolling, the camp collar lays open and flat in a distinct, casual way that does not allow for ties. There is sometimes a loop on the lower point on the buttonhole side of the collar, which could in theory attach to the opposite button, but probably won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This casual style often makes for a great short sleeve shirt, and many fun, patterned shirts use a camp collar. Pajama shirts also often use the camp collar. Interestingly, a Guayabera shirt, despite being a formal shirt, uses a camp collar. This is discussed in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A camp collar &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but does not necessarily, come in a one piece constrcution. I think that &lt;strong&gt;Capri collar&lt;/strong&gt; specifically refers to a one piece camp collar, but I am not sure. I've also seen a camp collar referred to as a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;revere collar&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; but can't find a definitive source on that either. And I've also seen it referred to as a resort collar or vacation collar, but those are pretty much just made up names that a few brands used for cheap marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hear the term &lt;strong&gt;runaway collar&lt;/strong&gt;, a person is referring to any of the above collars worn with a jacket in such a way that the collar falls over the tailored jacket. Sometimes, people do this by accident, and it looks bad. Sometimes, people do this on purpose, and it looks good. A camp collar, because it naturally sits open, is a good way to experiment with the intentional runaway collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Band collar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/m1WrQ6h.jpg"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/C8g0eF5.jpg"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;), also known as a &lt;strong&gt;Grandad collar&lt;/strong&gt;, is... Just a plain strip of fabric around the neck. There's nothing rolling or folding over the band, it's just the band. The band goes all the way around the neck, buttoning in the center -- this is distinct from the Nehru or Mandarin collar below. This collar, since it obviously cannot support a tie, is obviously casual. You may see it in popovers. It's not very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/XdbvSOA.jpg"&gt;mandarin collar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as a &lt;strong&gt;Nehru collar&lt;/strong&gt;, is similar to a band collar, except that there is a gap in the middle where the button might go. The collar buttons below that gap. This collar style is not only used in shirting, but also in a &amp;quot;Nehru Jacket,&amp;quot; an Indian equivalent to our suit jackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;mandarin&amp;quot; collar is named for mandarins, a particular sort of... official scholar / bureaucrat in China... well, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_(bureaucrat)"&gt;the etymology is long and weird&lt;/a&gt;, but there it is in case you care. It later earned the name Nehru collar from Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru -- however, he usually wore &lt;em&gt;jackets&lt;/em&gt; with this kind of collar, and that's usually how the term &amp;quot;Nehru Collar&amp;quot; is used -- &amp;quot;mandarin&amp;quot; is both the older name and the name more appropriate for shirting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/XPsxj40.jpg"&gt;Wing Collar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a funny thing. Trying to describe it... It's kind of like a stiff band collar with a miniature spread collar sticking out at the front. Just two small flaps. This collar is accommodates a bow tie, and is pretty exclusively meant for tuxedo shirts -- see the discussion of eveningwear below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/Shawl-Collar.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to Talk About Collared Shirts"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A unique "shawl collar" shirt from 100 Hands.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/XBZI9yK.jpg"&gt;Shawl Collar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; technically exists, but it's hard to find on a shirt. This one is from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDhHfOdJCWI/"&gt;100 Hands&lt;/a&gt;. You'll see shawl collars more often on knitwear, although a &amp;quot;shawl collar cardigan&amp;quot; is a little different, the shawl there is more... lapel-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, most of these collars can be a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/QB2Ohrm.jpg"&gt;contrasting collar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- a different color/pattern from the rest of the shirt. A contrasting collar is most often white. You could also get a contrasting cuff or placket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting collars come from the days of &lt;strong&gt;detachable shirt collars&lt;/strong&gt; -- since your collar gets dirty faster than everything else, people used to detach them from their shirts to be washed separately. If you buy your shirt collar separately, you will probably go for a versatile color -- solid white. This was a big deal -- Troy, NY was the fourth wealthiest city in the US, and was known as the &amp;quot;Collar City&amp;quot; for manufacturing these collars. Yeah. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="howtotalkaboutshirtingfabrics"&gt;How to talk about shirting fabrics.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shirting fabric is a yarn of some material, woven or knit in some pattern. When choosing your fabric, you might not only want to consider material and weave, but also weight, ply, and of course, color and pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="materials"&gt;Materials&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cotton&lt;/strong&gt; is your basic shirting material, covering a huge variety of both dressy and casual shirts, and easily the majority. It's cheap, light enough, and soft enough. It can be woven in a million ways, each of which provides a nice textural contrast to a wool suit and silk tie. When I discuss weaves below, almost all of them will usually come in cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton is sometimes treated in a variety of ways so that it does not require ironing. Some of these treatments involve formaldehyde. That sounds scary. However, aside from potential comfort issues, these treatments are perfectly safe and should not scare you. The amount of formaldehyde on the garment, even before its first wash, even in the worst case, is negligible, and would not be absorbed by your skin anyway. That said, different treatments can sometimes irritate the skin, and personal preference can play a big role here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linen&lt;/strong&gt;, which is normally woven in the linen weave, is a little bit less versatile. Okay, it's much less versatile. A pure linen shirt is almost always casual -- people will wear them as dress shirts in some climates, but there's a bit of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linen wrinkles. It wrinkles like crazy. Fashion photography is really bad about this -- you'll see a lot of fresh linen that was opened, maybe ironed on the spot, and worn carefully so as to not show the fabric's true nature. But if you want your shirt not to be wrinkled while you're wearing it, you are going to have a problem with linen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,if you're willing to embrace the wrinkles, linen can be amazing. Quality linen starts off soft and gets softer over time. It's light, and breathable, to the point of keeping you amazingly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love linen. But it's not for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linen is made from the &lt;strong&gt;flax&lt;/strong&gt; plant. If you see people advertising a &amp;quot;flax&amp;quot; shirt, that's linen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramie&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hemp&lt;/strong&gt; are rarer fabrics kind of like linen. Ramie is a little coarser and probably doesn't age as well, but it's probably cheaper than linen. Hemp is probably closer to Linen. Hemp fibers are very long though, about twice as long as linen fibers, so it can oten be strong, and used for rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wool&lt;/strong&gt; is a miracle fabric, but not the standard choice for shirting. Whether this is because of the expense, or because cheap wool can be itchy, or because it doesn't provide a textural variation with suiting, a few companies are trying to challenge the default, and promote Wool shirting, often as an alternative to performance shirting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wool is breathable and soft. It has natural anti-microbial and anti-wrinkle properties, helping avoid the need for non-iron treatments. It's warm, but still breathable, so it can actually be comfortable in warm temperatures, depending on the specific weave and weight of the fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rayon&lt;/strong&gt; including &lt;strong&gt;Viscose&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Modal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lyocell&lt;/strong&gt;, is a cool fabric for casual shirting. It's a synthetic silk-like material great for camp collar shirts and loud prints. Modal is more like cotton than the others. Each form of rayon has some unique properties. I encourage you to study them separately if you are interested. Some people advertise &lt;strong&gt;Bamboo&lt;/strong&gt; as a shirting material. That's one of the plants they use to make rayon from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For shirting, &lt;strong&gt;Silk&lt;/strong&gt; is an extreme luxury fabric. It has a sheen that is... dangerous to work with, but also a beautiful drape and extreme comfort. The main problem, aside from quality silk being expensive (and potential ethical issues), is that caring for silk is rather difficult. It may be more expensive to have cleaned than wool, and might need such cleaning more often, and might not last as long. If you go this route, good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyester&lt;/strong&gt; is probably bad. Cheap bargain bin shirts will either be made of polyester or cotton, and cheap polyester is probably worse than cheap cotton. Many &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;performance&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; brands will use polyester... mostly to save money, but realy not deliver anything special. Sometimes you get some wrinkle-resistance or stretch, but it's usually not all that special. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, a few performance shirtmakers will use specific formulations of polyester that actually do have some upsides. Again, this is a situation where you have to do a lot of your own research -- most of what you'll see out there is marketing nonsense, so look for reviews on platforms like Reddit where you can get around the marketing and dig into the facts with thorough comparative reviews and people who understand these materials deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of curse, all of these materials can come in &lt;strong&gt;blends&lt;/strong&gt;. Linen blends are smart, as they can help you keep cool without excessive wrinkling. Silk can be an expensive component but still provide comfort and drape as part of a blend. Polyester or &lt;strong&gt;nylon&lt;/strong&gt; might be used in performance blends for good reasons, or for cheap reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flannel&lt;/strong&gt; is a fabric that might be made from a brushed cotton or wool, often in a poplin or twill weave, and often (but not necessarily) with ccertain patterns named after the fabric. Yes, this definition is murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirt buttons are usually either made from a plastic resin or mother of pearl, although metal snaps exist -- I'll talk about buttons below. Detail stitching and the threads used to stitch on buttons might be different materials from the shirt body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="weavesandknits"&gt;Weaves and Knits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three fundamental &lt;strong&gt;Weaves&lt;/strong&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;plain weaves&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twill weaves&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;satin weaves&lt;/strong&gt;. On top of that, there are some special weaves that are a little more interesting. And after that, we'll have to talk about knit shirting. So let's dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a lot of guides include photos of the weaves here, which... I don't think is very useful. You don't care how the fabric looks under a microscope, you really care how it feels and behaves. Unfortunately, that means you're about to see a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plain Weaves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poplin&lt;/strong&gt; is a light, simple weave, good for dress shirts because it doesn't wrinkle much. &lt;strong&gt;Broadcloth&lt;/strong&gt; is the same weave as poplin, except generally dense, and probably even better for dress shirts. &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/bf674e4c-ed35-40f5-a58e-d9c078f10786"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-on-end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is poplin, except one of the threads is white and another is colored, so the alternation creates a certain visual effect. &lt;strong&gt;Chambray&lt;/strong&gt; is a blue and white end-on-end, except usually a little heavier, but still pretty light and breathable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; is a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;basket weave&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; which is a type of plain weave. It creates a fabric that is usually thicker and heftier than most poplins and twills. Traditionally considered casual, you can still dress oxford up with a blazer and tie -- or dress it down and wear it alone. Oxford Cloth is one of the ingredients in the classic &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Cloth Button Down&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;OCBD&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; a commonly recommended staple in basic wardbobes. &lt;strong&gt;Pinpoint Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; is a little denser and a little more dressy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;Imperial Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; is actually very different in effect from the other oxfords. It's a textured, dressy, luxurious fabric, that might be better compared to broadcloth than oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linen&lt;/strong&gt;. Wait, am I in the wrong section? Nope. There's a plain weave called the linen weave, and it's probably the weave used for your 100% linen shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taffeta&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shantung&lt;/strong&gt; are plain weaves usually used for silky fabrics, and thus not super relevant to shirting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twill weaves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twill can be similar to Poplin, but it's a little less breathable, and softer. Still quite good for dress shirts. &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/9Q9GtW3.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herringbone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is twill, except, like End-on-End, it involves alternating colors, creating a zig-zag sort of pattern. &lt;strong&gt;Denim&lt;/strong&gt; is a twill fabric. You can have a light denim shrit that's more wearable than you'd think. Obviously, denim shirting is quite casual. To help illustrate, chino is a twill fabric, but not one that would be used for shirting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin"&gt;Satin weaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are the third archetype after Plain Weaves and Twill Weaves. &lt;strong&gt;Charmeuse&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of satin weave. When cotton or other non-silky fabrics are woven in a satin weave, the resulting fabric is a &lt;strong&gt;sateen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piqué&lt;/strong&gt; (pronounced pee-kay), aka &lt;strong&gt;Marcella&lt;/strong&gt;, is a weave commonly used in polo shirts, but also specifically required for white tie shirting. For context, white Tie also requires a marcella bow tie and marcella waistcoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seersucker"&gt;Seersucker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a weird weave often used with cotton. It produces a fabric with ridges similar to corduroy, but instead of being a pile fabric, it's a crisp, light, breathable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine"&gt;Jacquard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a fancy method of weaving or knitting fancy patterns into shirts. I think jacquard weaves are, therefore, unique. &lt;strong&gt;Dobby&lt;/strong&gt; is similar, produced on a dobby loom instead of a Jacquard machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flannel&lt;/strong&gt; is both a pattern and a fabric, but more formally a fabric. The fabric is woven from brushed, napped, or sometimes just loosely woven yarns, and is thus very soft. It is used for casual shirts and pajamas, among other things. Wool flannel can be used for suiting, too! The check pattern you might think of as flannel is discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweed&lt;/strong&gt; is not a common fabric for shirting -- it's usually a thick, heavy wool fabric used for stuffy old blazers -- but 18 East and other brands are putting out cotton tweed shirting now, so fuck, I guess I have to talk about it. That said... It can be a plain or twill weave. It'll often be a soft woolen herringbone, but... I can't pin it down to one specific defining characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile&lt;/strong&gt; fabrics are those like &lt;strong&gt;velvet&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;corduroy&lt;/strong&gt; where a cut end of the yarn faces outward. This creates a sort of unique and intense softness. Such shirting is uncommon, but corduroy shirting is showing up a little more here and there -- it's worth considering. You might find a corduroy overshirt appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knit&lt;/strong&gt; fabrics are less common in shirting. &lt;a href="https://www.putthison.com/italian-knit-shirt-fantasy/"&gt;There's a cool italian vibe to a knit shirt&lt;/a&gt;. I think they're coming back. Polo shirts are easier to find in a knit fabric than a full button-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jersey&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of knit mostly used for tee shirts. However, brands like &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/white-jersey-shirt"&gt;Ring Jacket&lt;/a&gt; make buttoned, collared shirts from jersey. This one looks dressy, but probably feels unreasonably comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guys really love &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt; -- different fabrics sewn together, sometimes in totally different patterns. It echoes the spirit of mending worn clothing. It is often used in conjunction with &lt;strong&gt;sashiko&lt;/strong&gt;, a Japanese art involving visible needlework, also to show off artful, intentional mending. This can all appeal to the spirit of cherishing an old, beloved garment rather than throwing it out. This is obviously a sustainable practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patchwork may be done with scraps of old fabric, sometimes torn from an old shirt. On the other hand, high fashion brands might make patchwork clothing new, from scratch, with all new pieces, to simulate a worn and repaired appearance -- that is obviously not as sustainable a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="howtotalkaboutcommonshirtpatterns"&gt;How to talk about common shirt patterns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plain&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;Solid&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't need to tell you what a solid color is. You should have at least one of these shirts in white, and at least one in blue, but probably more than that. I like pastel pinks and purples, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtle &lt;strong&gt;textures&lt;/strong&gt; might still count as solid, or might be referred to by the name of their weave in some cases -- particualrly when those weaves use different colored threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checks&lt;/strong&gt; are basically any pattern that repeats in horizontal and vertical lines, particularly the following. &lt;strong&gt;Plaid&lt;/strong&gt; can technically refer to any check, but is often used to imply a tartan check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;graph check&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;windowpane check&lt;/strong&gt; is probably your basic check -- thin horizontal and vertical lines, often on a white or off-white platform. If the vertical and horizontal lines are different colors, you have a &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/550hRVJ.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tattersall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/gingham-check.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to Talk About Collared Shirts"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gingham&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/QVJEND3.jpg"&gt;Gingham Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of thin stripes on a shirt that's mostly background, the stripes are equally thick to the space between them, so that you have squares of background, squares of the stripe color, and squares of the intersection. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thatjcrewginghamshirt/"&gt;Blue and white gingham is extremely common&lt;/a&gt; -- but is not necessarily from J. Crew. A three-color gingham can exist too, which can allow a wider variety of squares to appear. Gingham checks can come in somewhat small to somewhat large scale. A relatively small gingham might be called &amp;quot;micro gingham.&amp;quot; A &lt;strong&gt;buffalo check&lt;/strong&gt; is a very large scale gingham check, often in either red + black or navy + white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan"&gt;tartan plaid&lt;/a&gt; is a complex multi-colored check itting into certain Scotish traditions. The &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/KciwNNW.png"&gt;Royal Stewart tartan&lt;/a&gt; is popular. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/6cDxBs7.png"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or Blackwatch tartan is a traditional green, blue, and black tartan. &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/d3MmAw5.jpg"&gt;Burberry&lt;/a&gt; is known for its own trademarked tartan, very commonly used on its scarves. Some consider this pattern tacky, almost like an Hermes belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;flannel&amp;quot; pattern is either a gingham (sometimes buffalo), plaid, or tartan check pattern. That said, flannel fabric can come in solid colors or any other pattern as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_(cloth)"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; is a light fabric generally either found in a fun-colored tartan plaid or a patchwork of fun colors. It is rather loud and can be hard to wear. It's most common in the summer. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/acutestyle/"&gt;@acutestyle&lt;/a&gt; on instagram and and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gezzaseyes/"&gt;Gerry&lt;/a&gt; wear a lot of madras -- @acutestyle tends to put it forward, while Gerry tends to layer with it in ways that can tone down its natural boldness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a glen check is a large-scale check pattern over a smaller-scale check pattern. This is uncommon on shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stripes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the language around stripe patterns is much more ambiguous. People will say that a certain term refers to narrow colored stripes on a background, even stripes, thin stripes, thick stripes, stripes of a particular width, vertical or horizontal stripes... But none of this is incredibly clear. The phrases you'll hear include &lt;strong&gt;Bengal stripes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;awning stripes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;candy stripes&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of these are vertical stripes, especially on dress shirts. Rugby shirts, which I'll discuss below, often use horizontal stripes. Diagonal stripes are unusual. My best understanding is that Bengal stripes might be vertical, even stripes, usually thin. Awning stripes might be vertical and uneven. Candy stripes might specifically be red and white bengal stripes. But this is really inconsistent between sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;floral&lt;/strong&gt; pattern is any pattern with flowers. This might look good with short sleeves and a camp collar in rayon to make a good &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;aloha&amp;quot; shirt&lt;/strong&gt;. A microfloral is a small-scale flower pattern, and is often used on otherwise dressy shirts by men who don't really know good ways to dress clothing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=paisley+pattern&amp;amp;t=ffab&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images"&gt;paisley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pattern is a sort of... teardrop amoeba thing. It's a very loud pattern not normally suited to shirting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, shirts can come in unique patterns. &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/mlC88Qp.jpg"&gt;Here's one from Knickerbocker NYC&lt;/a&gt;. See? Anything goes. That said, remember that unique patterns won't be traditional and aren't good for dress shirts. Again, they're good for fun camp collar shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern-matching&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the practice of continuing a pattern over a seam -- for example, a stripe or check might continue over an underarm seam, from the arm to the cuff, from the collar to the shirt body, or over the placket. This is pretty hard to do. Machines can't do it. You need people to line patterns up carefully, and know how the shirt will move when worn, so you won't usually see this done for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we talked about contrasting collars above. Really any piece of fabric can &lt;strong&gt;contrast&lt;/strong&gt;. Patchwork aside, the collar, cuffs, placket, pockets, and yoke &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; all contrast. A white collar and cuffs might be relatively safe, but you'll quickly enter dangerous territory. Colorful / patterned contrast, contrast on the inside o the collar or cuff or placket, and other unusual contrasts are... not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="whatotherstyledetailsdifferentiatecollaredshirts"&gt;What other style details differentiate collared shirts?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id="closurelayoutandmethod"&gt;Closure Layout and method&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've probably assumed, for a lot of this time, that &amp;quot;collared shirt&amp;quot; means something similar to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;button up shirt&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot; But a &amp;quot;button up&amp;quot; shirt has &lt;strong&gt;buttons&lt;/strong&gt; going from the top to the bottom, so that the shirt can open up all the way. Maybe you're bored by this. Surely, there's another way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course there is, it isn't rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/09/Yeossal-One-Button.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to Talk About Collared Shirts"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A one-button polo from Yeossal with a one-piece collar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collared shirt whose closure method only goes down partway is known as a &lt;strong&gt;popover&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;polo shirt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, a polo shirt should come in marcella / pique cotton, but they come in terry cloth, jersey cotton, linen, silk, and essentially any other fabric you can think of, except that, once you start to use more traditional shirting fabrics (other than marcella) are usually called popovers. Polos usually use short sleeves, a button closure, and a spread collar, although, again, any of these things can technically change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polo shirt with a white contrasting collar and cuffs might be called a &lt;strong&gt;Rugby Shirt.&lt;/strong&gt; These usually have a body with large horizontal stripes of white and some other color. They often also have a logo of some sort at the chest. This style lies on the casual end of prep style, and some guys &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now... Do you need buttons? Of course not! What other closure methods might you use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, collared shirts don't technically need buttons at all. You could absolutely have a collared shirt that uses a a &lt;strong&gt;zipper&lt;/strong&gt;, a shirt with a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; you can tie, or one that &lt;strong&gt;doesn't have any closure method at all&lt;/strong&gt;. Such shirts are usually not full-length openings, but popovers. See &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/St5nKGF.jpg"&gt;this no-closure polo from Zing Chen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/cOVnpxz.jpg"&gt;this zippered popover from Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt; (don't worry, my beard has been shorn since then). Also of note, you can have a shirt with only a single button, as evidenced by &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/hmaLhyy.jpg"&gt;this polo from Yeossal&lt;/a&gt; (which also features a one piece collar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, of course, there are tuxedo shirts, which accept &lt;strong&gt;studs&lt;/strong&gt; in place of buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a name for shirts with no closure method, but... I've lost track of what it is. It's, like, a little boy's name, like billy or tommy, but... Help me, please, can't you see I'm desperate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://putthison.com/the-charm-of-a-summer-collar/"&gt;A moroccan collar&lt;/a&gt; (which might not be a collar at all) has something to do with this conversation, but I don't entirely know what it is, so ask Derek Guy. I think it's a buttonless opening with some kind of internal points... Maybe it's like &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/YkqTugu.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but Derek seems to think it involves some kind of point, so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cuffstyle"&gt;Cuff Style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/OcQjJPv.jpg"&gt;cuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on a long-sleeved shirt is the strip of fabric around your wrist, and there's more going on there than you may think. You want to think about style, button layout, cut, pleats, and proportion. Keep in mind that a cuff is usually stiffer than other parts of the shirt -- I believe it is common to use fusible to make a cuff stiffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most collared shirts have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/ud7I8jC.jpg"&gt;barrel cuffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;buttoned cuffs&lt;/strong&gt;, which are buttoned, and go around the wrist, layering one over the other with the inside of each facing the wrist. That is to say, you can unbutton the shirt at the end of the sleeve to open it, maybe fold or roll it up. This is what you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very dressy shirts, however -- and this is more common in Europe -- can have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/bp5c4u5.jpg"&gt;french cuffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;double cuffs&lt;/strong&gt;, which will require &lt;strong&gt;cufflinks&lt;/strong&gt;, and often fold out, against one another, creating a sort of... Well, look at the photo, it's like that. Fancy. Sleeve rotation is more important than usual with French Cuffs for reasons that might be obvious. You can also arrange a french cuff like a barrel cuff, if you want to, but it will be thicker and a little different from a real barrel cuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also possible to have a closed, sweater-style cuff on a shirt, but this is uncommon, even on a knit shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about buttoned cuffs. You can have multiple buttons that range around the wrist -- allowing you to tighten or loosen the cuff, say around a watch -- or up and down the wrist and forearm. Two buttons right on the cuff can help keep the cuff from turning around itself. &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/SS9CL9S.jpg"&gt;Three on the cuff is the signature style affectation of Turnbull &amp;amp; Asser&lt;/a&gt;. A button further down the forearm can help give you control when folding or rolling the cuff up the arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buttoned cuff can be cut &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/O2IXN4f.jpg"&gt;rounded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/W9yWIpY.jpg"&gt;squared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;straight&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/ud7I8jC.jpg"&gt;mitered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is honestly not that interesting. If you don't want to think, go with a rounded cuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the arm of your shirt is probably smaller than the cuff opening, and since the cuff is probably a different piece than the rest of the sleeve, you should generally expect that the sleeve will be folded or pleated to fit into the cuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, do think about proportion. A longer cuff cuff doesn't just look different, but folds and rolls differently from a shorter cuff. Cuff circumference, sleeve length, cut, and number of buttons are all things to consider relative to cuff length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="placketstyle"&gt;Placket Style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that strip of buttonholes going down one side of your shirt? That might be what you call a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/0DrVvaA.png"&gt;placket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If there's nothing going on there, you might say there's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gt4V7YD.png"&gt;no placket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or call it a &lt;strong&gt;French placket&lt;/strong&gt;, which I guess is what happens when a placket surrenders halfway through being a placket. Casual shirts sometimes have no placket. But usually, there's an extra strip of fabric around those buttons, reinforcing them and adding a little stiffness via fusible. Plackets can be wider or narrower, with more or less visible stitching. A shirt without a visible placket might nevertheless use fusible to stiffen the area where the placket would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the closure methods described bove, a placket does not need to run the whole way down the shirt. If it does not, it might be called a popover or polo. Your pants' fly is, presumably, a covered placket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;covered placket&lt;/strong&gt; places a layer of fabric &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; the closure method, IE buttons or studs, so that you only see fabric from the front. This might be used for a tuxedo shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="otherdetails"&gt;Other Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hem&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a big one -- most shirts either have a longer hem, cut so that you are able to tuck it in -- ideal for dress shirts -- or a shorter hem, cut almost straight, so that it looks good untucked -- ideal for casual shirts. The ideal length for a shorter hem is about the center of your fly, or longer if you're wearing high-rise trousers. It shouldn't show any skin (or undershirt) when you move or sit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeve length. First, a shirt can either be &lt;strong&gt;short-sleeved&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;long-sleeved&lt;/strong&gt;. A short-sleeved button-up might be a bad idea -- a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up pretty consistently looks better. The big exceptions are polos and shirts with camp collars. A short-sleeved shirt is never a dress shirt. If a shirt has short sleeves, that shirt is casual. The one exception here is a Guayabera, discussed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways shirt sleeves are measured -- from the back of the neck to the tip of the cuff, and from the shoulder sleeve to the tip of the cuff. The former measurement is, roughly, the latter plus half of the shoulder width. Sometimes, on clothing with raglan sleeves, you'll see the sleeve measured from the underarm seam, but this is not very practical as it is hard to account for armhole size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, in case you see it -- you probably won't, in this context -- a &lt;strong&gt;raglan sleeve&lt;/strong&gt; is a sleeve that isn't attached at the top of the shoulder, but at the neck. This can improve range of motion, but doesn't allow for any structure at the shoulder. It makes more sense for tee shirts, knitwear, and sometimes overcoats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pockets&lt;/strong&gt;. Pockets are casual details. A dressy shirt ideally has no pockets. A casual shirt might have a left chest pocket or two pockets, but rarely just a right chest pocket. Those pockets might also have buttons, which might make a shirt even more casual -- two pleated pockets with two-button flaps would be at home on a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;western shirt&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; -- the type of thing a cowboy might wear, which also involves curved point designs around the pockets and yoke... You'll know a western shirt when you see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buttons&lt;/strong&gt; are usually made of &lt;strong&gt;Mother of Pearl&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;plastic resin&lt;/strong&gt;. The buttons and the thread used to sew them on can blend in with the shirt and its placket, or they can contrast. Mother of pearl is generally a milky white-ish color -- this, plus white thread, usually plays nice with a white shirt, and usually contrasts with dark or very colorful shirts -- obviously. Some shirts, especially western shirts, might use metal &lt;strong&gt;snaps&lt;/strong&gt; instead of buttons, perhaps with mother of pearl embellishments on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back of the shirt is more interesting than you might think. The top panel connecting your shoulders is called the &lt;strong&gt;yoke&lt;/strong&gt;. The yoke can be a &lt;strong&gt;split yoke&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that there is a seam separating the two sides of the panel for a little bit of added mobility. Better yet, there might be a &lt;strong&gt;box pleat&lt;/strong&gt; there offering a little range of fabric to really help your range of motion.. The back of a shirt might also just be one clean, solid piece -- no yoke, just solid shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there's a button on the back of the collar of a higher-end casual-ish shirt. This could help keep the collar or a tie in place, but it's kind of just for show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monograms&lt;/strong&gt; -- usually your initials -- are kind of dumb, if you ask me. They can be placed at the cuff, on the body, or... well, anywhere else, if you're feeling funky. The body is considered an Italian style, and generally not to be seen -- only get this if you're layering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="howdressyismyshirt"&gt;How dressy is my shirt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any shirt with a short hem cut for untucked wear is a &lt;strong&gt;casual&lt;/strong&gt; shirt, and generally, a casual shirt should have a hem cut for untucked wear. Any shirt with short sleeves, with one very specific exception, is a casual shirt. Any popover is a casual shirt. If you see a popover or short sleeved shirt with a hem designed for tucking, you are most likely looking at a terrible shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hear somebody talking about a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;sport shirt&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; that person might be a British aristocrat or a Brooks brother, talking about the optimal shirt for horseback riding, polo, cricket, or some other such nonsense. It might be an oxford, or a flannel, or a denim shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, shirts that might otherwise be dress shirts are, if the pattern is loud or strange enough, are casual shirts. Dress shirts should generally come in traditional patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, shirts in casual fabrics are, generally, casual shirts. Oxford and Linen are casual but can be dressed up, depending on the specific community, the weather, and the wearer's skill with an iron. Chambray and Denim are more casual can be dressed up as well, for variety. Dressing up flannel and rayon may be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dress Shirts&lt;/strong&gt; must always be tucked in. If the shirt is not long enough to stay tucked, then either it is not a dress shirt, or you are a very tall man requiring an unusually long dress shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formal Shirts&lt;/strong&gt; are generally those used in eveningwear -- back tie, white tie, and equivalents. Some people might use &amp;quot;formal shirt&amp;quot; to be synonymous with &amp;quot;dress shirt,&amp;quot; but this is technically not correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;tuxedo shirt&lt;/strong&gt;, has a covered placket, and sometimes pleats or ruffles. For proper &lt;strong&gt;black tie&lt;/strong&gt;, this shirt must be white with a wing collar or spread collar appropriate for showing off a bowtie. It will have a french cuffs and either studs (instead of buttons) or a covered placket. The front might have a &lt;strong&gt;bib&lt;/strong&gt; or a whole bunch of vertical &lt;strong&gt;pleats&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For white tie, one must wear a white shirt made of marcella cotton. There are more rules I don't care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/EAenEfR"&gt;Guayabera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, despite being a short sleeved shirt worn as a single layer, is a piece of formalwear. It can be dressed down, but is traditionally worn to weddings and by politicians in parts of the world where suiting is generally impractical. The Guayabera has been described as a &amp;quot;Mexican wedding shirt,&amp;quot; but you should generally not assume that it will be appropriate for any particular wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Guayabera is defined by characteristic vertical pleats -- very narrow, usually in two sets of five . It is uaually a white short sleeved camp collar shirt in cotton or linen with 2-4 patch pockets, although none of these elements are entirely necessary. Still, if you're trying to use it as formalwear, you want to check as many traditional boxes as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="howtotalkaboutshirtfit"&gt;How to talk about shirt fit.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual shirts and cheap dress shirts are often measured in &lt;strong&gt;alphabetical sizes&lt;/strong&gt; -- XS, S, M, L, XL, et cetera. This only works if your body fits to very standard, common proportions. Some brands expand to include slim/relaxed fits, which is helpful, and long/short lengths, which is good for a casual shirt as you will wear it untucked. You should generally view size charts on these shirts to ensure that the shirt's measurements are consistent with your own. There is no formal or numerical definition of &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; except as the brand chooses to describe its own sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-the-rack dress shirts are usually measured by two numbers: a &lt;strong&gt;neck size&lt;/strong&gt; and then an &lt;strong&gt;arm length&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, I am a 15.5 / 32, as my neck is a fairly average size and my arms are short. Sometimes, you will see the arm length as a range -- 32-33, or 33-34, et cetera. This does not mean it will fit all men in that range. It's an honest but somewhat unhelpful sign from brands whose QA cannot consistently provide the exact arm length you need. I would tend to demand a precise arm length -- brands as cheap as Charles Tyrwhitt can reliably get sleeve length right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many brands also offer slim / relaxed fits for dress shirts as well. Shirt length is generally not a concern, as your dress shirt will always be tucked in. If you are confused about that last bit, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere in this guide, and need to read it again. &lt;strong&gt;Your dress shirt will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be tucked in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirts can be &lt;strong&gt;made to measure&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;bespoke&lt;/strong&gt;, in which case the brand in question will customize some large number of measurements including chest, waist size, arm size, armhole size, cuff size, shoulder width, shirt length, possibly even button position -- they could make &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDiM-3ot9Q0"&gt;George and Jerry&lt;/a&gt; very happy men. When you hear &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;made to order&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; that might or might not mean &amp;quot;made to measure.&amp;quot; Usually, it means &amp;quot;made with some sort of customization in mind, but not much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When buttoned, a shirt's neck should obviously not be too tight or too loose. If you have trouble breathing, it's way too tight. If it's mildly uncomfortable, it might be too tight, but be careful, because the next size up might be too loose. If it's falling away from your skin, it's probably too loose. So try on two sizes, and consider the possibility that neither works for you before committing to that brand. This is all less important if you don't plan to wear the shirt buttoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of arm length, a long-sleeved shirt's arms should be visible under a tailored jacket, but only slightly.They should hit the end of the wrist, or, depending on your preference, slightly past there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrist opening is not too complicated, but sometimes you may want your non-dominant hand to have a larger opening to accomodate a watch. MTM shirtmakers can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm size is not too tricky, but some off-the-rack makers will have oversized, billowy arms to accomodate a large number of men. Don't go too slim, either, because that can restrict your range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armhole&lt;/strong&gt; opening is more important for comfort and range of motion than you might think. It's something MTM and Bespoke makers will recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleeve pitch&lt;/strong&gt; is worth considering. Essentially, if your sleeve always seems like it's twisted in some way, it might need to be turned at the shoulder by a tailor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of fit, you &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; want a dress shirt to be fairly slim throughout the chest and body, down to the waist so it can stay tucked in neatly. Linen and rayon shirts are often better worn loose. For most other shirts, fit comes down to personal preference. A more relaxed fit can convey a soft, relaxed effect; a slim, trim fit can look more neat and put-together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A casual shirt's length should generally reach about mid-fly, depending on how you wear your pants. you will often see this measured and referred to as &lt;strong&gt;back length&lt;/strong&gt;, since it's easier to consistently measure from the back of the collar to the hem than from any other point on a shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="alrightnowwhichonesshouldibuy"&gt;Alright, now which ones should I buy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/itemguides#wiki_shirting2"&gt;Here are a whole bunch of Reddit megathreads&lt;/a&gt;. They're good. Have fun with them. Dress shirts can be found &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/itemguides#wiki_shirting2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off the Rack&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;Ready to Wear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that fit is king, and that a shirt you can try on which does fit you is a better purchase than a shirt you can't try on that might fit you. Know a tailor. With that knowledge in hand, here are some brands I can recommend, in generally increasing price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ctshirts.com/us/mens-shirts/"&gt;Charles Tyrwhitt&lt;/a&gt; at their 3/$100 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-shirts"&gt;Spier and Mackay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pjatr.com/t/SUNHR01GR0lDSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;Twillory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;) -- the affiliate link here should give you two shirts for the price of one, plus a &amp;quot;free gift.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/"&gt;Asket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.portugueseflannel.com"&gt;Portuguese Flannel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://18east.co/"&gt;18 East&lt;/a&gt; for unique textures and prints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yeossal.com/"&gt;Yeossal&lt;/a&gt; for polos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitmanvintage.com/"&gt;Gitman Vintage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/collections/all"&gt;Ring Jacket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://turnbullandasser.com/"&gt;Turnbull &amp;amp; Asser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.100hands.nl/"&gt;100 Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made to Measure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, locality is important to fit, but for a new reason. Being measured in person by the company in question and having them available to remake or tailor your shirt in person are very valuable. Furthermore, being able to feel their fabrics in person also helps ensure a good fit. That said, here are some worthy brands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/collection/all-shirts"&gt;Spier and Mackay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blacklapel.com/refer-a-friend-coupon-code/8bfd0073dca3ca874df4bb0d9a7bc34e922da3af6880b22a15b2195cdeda4ba5"&gt;Black Lapel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://blacklapel.com"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;) -- the referral link here should give you $25 off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://propercloth.com/"&gt;Proper Cloth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.altonlane.com"&gt;Alton Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://turnbullandasser.com/collections/made-to-measure-shirts"&gt;Turnbull &amp;amp; Asser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.100hands.nl/"&gt;100 Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bespoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking a brand local to you is even more important here. Getting a shirt made bespoke requires that you be measured by the person who will cut the fabric, often more than once. It's possible to do this through trunk shows, but easier and more convenient to do this with a local tailor. That's often not a big brand, it's a smalll local business, and a person whose name you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, here are a few brand names I can recommend anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://turnbullandasser.com/pages/bespoke"&gt;Turnbull &amp;amp; Asser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.100hands.nl/"&gt;100 Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lucavitabile.it/bespoke-shirts"&gt;Luca Vitabile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it's worth noting that each brand is having a sale or labor day weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

Note that I received this pair at no cost in consideration of my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came with two sets of laces -- one is quite waxy, and one isn't waxy at all. I prefer the soft, non-waxy laces for my own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've actually had these for a while, but due to quarantine, I've probably worn them... about ten times. Maybe less. The full review might take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Style-wise&lt;/strong&gt; they're a little unique. As far as minimal white sneakers go, they're not all that easy to wear. I feel like these look weirdly good with my sweatpants, and other cozy things. I say weirdly, because... they're not actually the softest or most comfortable sneakers out there, not by a long shot -- more on that below. But the smooth curves and wholecut last just work to make them look soft, and play nice with soft and cozy textures. That said, they're still white sneakers, and they'll work just fine with jeans, chinos, or, as I showed here, sateen pants. I'd just go with another style -- like the minimal &lt;a href="https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/reid-sneakers?rfsn=3353795.2c9040&amp;amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;amp;variant=29621930557519"&gt;Reid&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/morgen-trainers-leather-suede?variant=29673810919503"&gt;Morgen GAT&lt;/a&gt; -- for those purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure this is my favorite last for a wholecut sneaker, but I've only seen a few of them, and the other one I'm thinking of costs ~$350, so there's no real norm or standard.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's see what happens as they break in. You will notice that even the first photos, there's some grain break. &lt;em&gt;This is not loose grain&lt;/em&gt;. The short version is... Grain break might mean they've been worn before -- maybe somebody tried them on and returned them, maybe theyre seconds, hard to say. If I had actually paid for these shoes, I'd complain. But considering I didn't... These shoes have got to go somewhere. I'd rather they throw them at influencers than throw them out or pass them off as firsts. If you're worried about loose grain: Loose grain is extremely rare, and it rarely gets through even low-level manufaceurers, so you can ask somebody who understands leather better than me, but it's not likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the uppers are creasing a lot... I suppose that's the risk of a wholecut, the style really shows creases quite aggressively. I don't know, maybe there will be a certain charm to that. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this style might work better in suede, since suede doesnt' really crease in the same way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;strong&gt;comfort&lt;/strong&gt;... well, they're fine. These aren't athletic shoes, they're minimal white leather sneakers. You're not going for a run in these, you're not playing sports. These soles are clearly not made for ultraboost-style comfort -- they're pretty stiff -- but it's not a problem for walking. The only comfort issue I really have walking is the tongue. The tongue on these -- and I believe other Beckett Simonon sneakers -- sticks up in a way that, if I'm wearing no show socks or low cut snocks, digs into my shins. This is super annoying. However, my reasonably thick higher-cut socks negate this issue. There's elastic helping hold the tongue in place. The lining is all vachetta leather, and that's really better in the long run than fabric linings that can get damaged or start to stink, but it's a little rough to wear sockless before the break-in. After that break in is done, it will be very comfortable, but I'd still wear socks because of the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;, they're nice. I think that, while a few Redditors may have have overhyped this brand, comparing them to Common Projects, Meermin, et cetera... their sneakers are available for $120 (with a referral code) or less on sale (everything is 25% off right now for labor day weekend, but I don't think this stacks with referral codes), so I really wasn't expecting the moon. They're a &lt;strong&gt;very good value&lt;/strong&gt; for the low end of leather sneakers, and my limited experience with their other offerings makes me think they're probably a good value all around.&lt;/p&gt;

It varies a little in lighting.

Nisolo Wool Crew Socks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9274546-12594029?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnisolo.com%2F"&gt;Nisolo&lt;/a&gt;. They asked me to stick with the affiliate links for now, so here you go.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9274546-12917052?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnisolo.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-socks%2Fproducts%2Fwool-crew-sock-brown"&gt;Nisolo Wool Crew Sock in Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;:  22% &amp;quot;Upcycled&amp;quot; Wool / 32% RPET (recycled plastic) / 42% Nylon / 4% Spandex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium -- I followed the size guide, and that worked for me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $20. Note that I received this pair at no cost in consideration of my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These socks are pretty &lt;strong&gt;comortable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cozy&lt;/strong&gt;. They're not the softest socks I have -- more detail on that below -- but on foot, they're really not bad, and I mostly just think... they're cozy. They're thick and warm enough that they'd hold their own on most winter days, but thin and breathable enough that I managed to wear them out on a relatively cool summer day without issue. 22% wool might not seem like a lot, but a little goes a long way to help regulate temperature. Wool is magic like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, they're &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; thick enough that they pair &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; with the annoying tongue on my Gellers above! If Beckett Simonon's sneaker tongue troubles you, consider these socks as a complement.&lt;/p&gt;

They are closer to my Uniqlo color socks in thickness, and... The color socks are softer to the hand, but they're a cotton poly blend, wool socks are just another story. They're softer than my chunky woolrich knit socks or my J. Crew camp socks. They're not as cozy as my smartwool socks, but my smartwool socks are ugly as hell, and distinctly winter-only, so let's give the Nisolo socks a pass on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have a lot of socks. The point is, the material is certainly not bad to the hand, but nicer on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that these will actually last pretty long. They tell me they're machine washable, and the blend, while low in wool, isn't bad -- nylon is pretty much necessary to make socks last, as my 100% merino wool Falke socks can attest to -- they look like swiss cheese. I suspect the material will soften up a little after a wash or two, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing they like to talk about, a lot like Asket which has made a couple of appearances on this blog, is &lt;strong&gt;ethics&lt;/strong&gt;. They provide some good amount of traceability. The fabric was milled and the socks were &lt;strong&gt;made in North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt; by a family-owned mill called &lt;a href="https://www.recovertex.com/"&gt;Recovertex&lt;/a&gt;. That's cool. Obviously, the fabric uses a lot of &lt;strong&gt;recycled materials&lt;/strong&gt; too. As far as I can tell, all of their product pages state the factory they're made in -- a lot of products are made in Mexico. They also have an &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9274546-12917052?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnisolo.com%2Fcollections%2Fethical-marketplace"&gt;Ethical Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; on their site. All of this looks pretty good to me -- not just lip service to ethics, but some real, meaningful information here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're here, Nisolo is having a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9274546-12917052"&gt;relatively large sale right now&lt;/a&gt; -- use code &amp;quot;LDW&amp;quot; for 25% off sale and 20% off full price styles -- with quite a few shoes coming in under $100. I haven't tried their shoes on yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/search?q=nisolo&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;here are a bunch of mixed reviews&lt;/a&gt; from the snobs over at Reddit's &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/"&gt;/r/goodyearwelt&lt;/a&gt;. Although the reviews are mixed, these prices are very low, lower than almost anything else you see on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/"&gt;/r/goodyearwelt&lt;/a&gt;, and they're doing that without sweatshops, so if this is where your budget is, and you like a pair, I'd say go for it. Shoot, I'm tempted by some of those suede slippers...&lt;/p&gt;

Who would have guessed it, we're still in quarantine. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Americans didn't feel like quarantining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been holding back the urge to do this again. The &lt;a href="https://prf.hn/l/rdzBRgK"&gt;Mr. Porter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://prf.hn/l/rdzBRgK"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;) sale was fun as always, &lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/"&gt;Spier and Mackay&lt;/a&gt; had some solid sales in the meantime, &lt;a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/"&gt;Supply &amp;amp; Advise&lt;/a&gt; kept going strong, and &lt;a href="https://meermin.com/"&gt;Meermin&lt;/a&gt; even had a second sale. Meermin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this Ring Jacket sale needs to be acknowledged. So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Grey-Linen-Suit-w-Pocket.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A linen suit from Ring Jacket. I love the way they display the sleeve in the pocket for product photography. It helps me imagine the drape and softness I know they can achieve.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="ringjacket"&gt;Ring Jacket&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/"&gt;Ring Jacket&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. You should generally know that of any brand carried by &lt;a href="https://thearmoury.com/"&gt;The Armoury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/"&gt;Supply &amp;amp; Advise&lt;/a&gt;, but... Really, Ring Jacket is something special. Especially at these prices, in some cases more than half off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brand takes what's great about classic tailoring and what's comfortable about casualwear and combines them into some truly luxurious clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold! In example, I give you &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/tan-jersey-shirt"&gt;this tan Jersey shirt&lt;/a&gt;. Jersey, in case you're not familiar with various knits, is the stuff tee shirts are made of. Why don't they make more of these? Well, a few reasons. One is that dress shirts are mired in tradition, so people want them to fit traditional or dressy standards. Another is that jersey isn't a very structured fabric, so it'll be hard to make a jersey shirt look good. Hard, unless you're Ring Jacket, who makes everything look easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also pioneers in the field of natural fabrics with techy qualities. The &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/brown-prince-of-wales-balloon-jacket"&gt;Balloon Jacket&lt;/a&gt; is the classic example of this. A 100% wool jacket woven with completely natural stretch and even more wrinkle-resistance than the worsted wool you already love. Add that to worsted wool's natural breathability, anti-odor qualities, and all of the other magical things wool does, and you have a fabric that justifies its normally crazy price tag -- and makes this lower one a steal. Their &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/navy-calm-twist-trousers"&gt;calm twist&lt;/a&gt; fabric has similarly splendid features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also do cool blends, like htis &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/grey-houndstooth-jacket"&gt;cotton silk linen&lt;/a&gt; blend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Olive-Jersey-Shirt-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1619" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Cord-Jacket-1.jpg" width="2000" height="2999" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Blend-Blazer-1.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More of the Ring Jacket sale. This is how you make tailoring casual.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally... I just have to point out how great a deal &lt;a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/navy-corduroy-shirt-jacket"&gt;this particular Corduroy shirt jacket is&lt;/a&gt;. Good outerwear does not come cheap, and this is great outerwear, in the most versatile color you're going to get, and it's.. Okay, $175 might still not be cheap to you, but you're going to get way more than what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: &lt;a href="https://thearmoury.com/"&gt;The Armoury&lt;/a&gt; has also temporarily reduced prices on Ring Jacket by 20%. They don't even want to use the word sale. This is not as good a deal, obviously, but it covers a much greater number of offerings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Spier-Drago-Blue-Gun-Check-Blazer.jpg" width="1633" height="2643" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Spier-Navy-VBC-Flannel-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Spier-Angelico-Check-Blazer-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Spier and Mackay is known for its blazers. The fabrics here are great: a Drago blue gun check, a VBC navy flannel, and an Angelico check, respectively&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="spierandmackay"&gt;Spier and Mackay&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/"&gt;Spier and Mackay&lt;/a&gt; has always been a good value, but they've also had a standing sale selection for a while. And through quarantine, they've usually been offering 25% off &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I finally bought my first suit from them last week when they had 25% off suits, so I got a navy DB that would easily have been worth the $450 original price for just $261.50. Expect a review on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, with code SALE25, you can get 25% off their entire sale selection. That means half-canvassed suits with great materials as low as &lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/indigo-micro-check-10575-0172-2112-f1h1-fw19"&gt;$187.50&lt;/a&gt;, merino wool sweaters down to &lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/dark-brown-merino-wool-crewneck-ec17105-cnk-fw19-482"&gt;$30&lt;/a&gt;, trousers as low as... &lt;a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/washed-red---cotton---final-sale-514-33-f1h1"&gt;wait, 22.50&lt;/a&gt;? That can't be right... Guys, buy fast before Spier &amp;amp; Mackay turns into J. Crew. Seriously, don't expect these sales to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Wool-Silk-Linen-Suit.jpg" width="1000" height="1250" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Overcoat.jpg" width="1080" height="1350" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Loafers.jpg" width="1080" height="1351" alt="Quarantine Sales -- Part Two"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some of Cavour's cooler-looking options.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="cavour"&gt;Cavour&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/search/bysearchdefinition/1"&gt;Cavour&lt;/a&gt; is the hot new up-and-comer in the tailoring game. Well, not that new, they're a few years old, but they've still got that new brand smell on them. And their stuff is not only on a deep sale -- 50% off most things -- but, with the code &amp;quot;extrasale15,&amp;quot; deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put into perspective how good a sale this is, &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/1894/mini-birdseye-suit"&gt;this fully canvassed suit&lt;/a&gt; is going for $310.25. Don't like suits? Fine. Here's &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/2070/nylon-field-jacket"&gt;a field jacket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/1409/wool-cashmere-overcoat"&gt;an overcoat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/2076/suede-field-jacket"&gt;a suede jacket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/en/22/men-loafers"&gt;some dope loafers&lt;/a&gt;... You've got a lot of cool options here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wanna know the kicker? Cavour also carries other brands, and some of them are on sale, including Drake's, Canali a small &lt;a href="https://cavour.co/xx/147/50-sale?p=789&amp;amp;orderBy=Published"&gt;Ring Jacket selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to support great menswear in this difficult time if we want to see it continue, and... they're making it &lt;em&gt;very, very&lt;/em&gt; easy on us. Let's make sure they survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told you not to expect these sales to last, but the unfortunate thing is, given our reaction in the US, there's a reasonable chance they will. I guess I'll see you again in the fall and winter, especially if we really force all of our schools open...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, at least we'll all look fly as hell from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a fan of candid photography. Posing for photos can look and feel awkward. Unfortunately, in Menswear, it's a necessary evil. Evil, that is, unless you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know how to pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't. But you know who does? Jamie, Ethan and Marco. These guys dance, play, eat, drink, finger-gun... They make their photos stand out, they highlight what's great about their clothes, and they have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photographer by trade, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jkf_man/"&gt;Jamie Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; found himself with a lot of free time in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His solution to this lack of client work was to experiment with new lighting techniques, whatever props he had handy, and, as you can tell, some very animated poses. He and his moustache made goofy faces, danced like nobody was shooting, and... ate, and drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/JFK-Drinking-1.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/JFK-Sad-1.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/JFK-Drinking-Glass-1.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/JFK-Eating-1.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eating is weird.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating and drinking are weird. Eating in particular is a strange activity -- it's one we're conditioned to associate with vulnerability. The adrenal response is our &amp;quot;fight and flight&amp;quot; response -- it represents us at our strongest and fastest. But digestion and rest are quite opposed; we do these things when we know we're safe. This deeply ingrained association has created many shy eaters -- people cover their mouths when they eat. Characters in movies and on TV sit at a dinner table but generally aren't actually seen eating. Eating is intimate; it's something we do on dates. So think about it: how often do you see photos of people eating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to look a little vulnerable -- or to look downright goofy -- eating is a really unique, unusual, and powerful way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't for the faint of heart. Most of us don't have Jamie's talent as a photographer or model. This series of photos reflects the creativity and skill required for both photography and modeling. But if you're feeling like a new challenge for your fit pics -- grab some goofy-looking food, and try to look good eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of eating, let's talk about...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Ethan-Eating-2.jpg" width="640" height="960" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Etahn-Eating-1.jpg" width="640" height="960" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Ethan-Boba-Snort.jpg" width="1024" height="1544" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;"I'm just naturally dumb." – Ethan M. Wong, 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="ethanmwong"&gt;Ethan M. Wong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ethanmwong/"&gt;Ethan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/"&gt;Street x Sprezza&lt;/a&gt; knows how to eat on camera. Again, Ethan is a photographer. He's framed these photos carefully, and he's framed them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a good deal more candor in Ethan's photos. He doesn't really even think of it as posing. He feels silly, he hands his friends a camera, and he just... acts the way he acts. You need a bit of personality to do this, and you need some friends who are willing to take a dumb photo and not question it. That's trickier than it sounds -- when I tell my friends to take candid photos of me, they get confused and ask me to pose. By the time they figure out what I want, the moment's gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you're probably not surrounded with friends right now, but you can at least attempt to recreate this magic with a tripod and a timer. But if you ask me, as long as you control the camera, you're posing, and that's exactly what you're trying to get away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan's gang has got the magic formula figured out. He knows how to be his own precious self, and they know how to capture it without ruining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Ethan-Telephone.jpg" width="640" height="960" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Ethan-Cameras-1.jpg" width="640" height="959" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/SAD-Bois-Dancing-2.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Etahn-Animated.jpg" width="640" height="960" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Ethan's crew... They run a &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/styleanddirection"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/styleanddirection"&gt;Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;) called &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/styleanddirection/"&gt;Style and Direction&lt;/a&gt;. Check 'em out, and stay tuned for their Patreon launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime... Prepare for new levels of strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Marco-2.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Marco-1.jpg" width="1440" height="1800" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Marco-4.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Marco-3.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marco can &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="marcomartinez"&gt;Marco Martinez&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p0cketman/"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt;, aka &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamotejoe"&gt;/u/kamotejoe&lt;/a&gt;, can dance. And somehow, he can dance well enough that even the still photos of him dancing look cool. Again, we are faced with the unfortunate fact that these great poses require hard work, natural talent, and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His style is... Quite obviously, weird. Engineered Garments, Needles, Kapital, and a bunch of other strange brands coalesce into one of the most unique wardrobes out there. But he just has so much fun with it, and that's infectious. It took me a while, but it's really not that hard to see why he's one of Reddit's favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit loves Marco so much that, when he suggested a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/glhy54/mfa_theme_waywt_challenge_freaky_friday/"&gt;Freaky Friday&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; theme thread, many users decided to dress, and pose, as him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Fluxknot-as-Marco.jpg" width="1920" height="3414" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Bond-as-Marco.jpg" width="3001" height="2000" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Manliftingbanner-as-Marco.jpg" width="2220" height="3108" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;/u/fluxknot, Eric M. Cotecson (/u/bond__jamesbond), and /u/manliftingbanner, all playing as Marco for MFA's "Freaky Friday" thread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you thought they imitated Marco because it would be easy, I've got bad news for you -- he's been dancing for 9 years, and he still goes to classes. And not only that, but he's constantly thinking about his clothing when he poses. He's thinking about what lines his movements will highlight. While &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; having fun and doing what comes natural to him. Does that sound like a paradox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His advice is encouraging, but not in the way you want it to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all things it takes time but even small improvements should be celebrated. The most important place to start is to learn to relax and lean into the groove + music when dancing. Every dance style has a specific groove that brings it to life which is why most dance classes start with a groove warmup. Because we're given so many messages by society to &amp;quot;fit in,&amp;quot; dancing is a fundamental reprogramming of things we've picked up and is actually an act of rebellion. Hence, why most famous dance styles like breaking, locking, vogue, and house started within marginalized urban communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I wouldn't sweat trying to dance like a pro dancer because effort and feeling matter so much more than &amp;quot;looking good&amp;quot; and I think that concept is not fair to attach to something as subjective as dance. It's important to feel great above all, energy permeates through to other people more than how &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; one looks. That's my long-winded way of saying that finding what works at a pace comfortable to you is the most important!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome. I'll keep trying this for nine years and if I take a good photo between now and then, I'll just consider it a bonus. I'll share my failures in the meantime -- I'll attach a couple below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out writing this article hoping I'd be able to give you some good advice on how to pose in more unique ways, or learn how to do it better myself. You can see how well that turned out below -- I'm sharing my failures just for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest lesson is that... Art is hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honesty is a part of it. You have to get comfortable in front of a camera, you have to be a naturally silly person. And you need some raw talent. But then you need to work at it. Remember that film is cheap, and that you're probably not using any. That, if today's photos are a little better than yesterday's, then you're making progress. And that maybe, one day, you can look as fly on camera as these crazy fucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So try your best. Get your funky flow going. Take those photos like nobody's watching, and then post them, even when they're bad. Send me your attempts, if you have some you're proud of, and we'll see -- maybe I'll find a chance do an article like this again, with a few new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/KoRaehm"&gt;here's the imgur album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get ready to laugh at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Me-Capoeira.jpg" width="1080" height="1439" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Me-Meditating.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Me-Dancing.jpeg" width="1469" height="1958" alt="Fun Poses in Menswear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Do as I say, not as I do.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>How Formal is Formalwear?</title><description>While it's mired in tradition and rules, I'm going to take this opportunity to express something about eveningwear: I'm going to explain the odd sense in which eveningwear is *more casual* than lounge suiting.</description><link>http://localhost:2368/how-formal-is-formalwear/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e9c5749aac91109aaebd9e8</guid><category>eveningwear</category><category>classic menswear</category><category>loud</category><dc:creator>Daniel Hakimi</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 22:29:31 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Mathias-Lefevre-Morocco.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Mathias-Lefevre-Morocco.jpg" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're new to menswear or steeped in it, you've no doubt seen some sliding scale of formality with extreme casual all the way on the left, and either the tuxedo or white tie all the way on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified view at something that's far more complex than the one dimension with which you've been presented. As you want to progress, you'll want to consider not only the factors that make a thing more formal or casual, but the various senses in which a thing might be more formal or casual, and which further your intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's mired in tradition and rules -- the black tie dress code is extremely specific -- I'm going to take this opportunity to express something about eveningwear: I'm going to explain the odd sense in which eveningwear is &lt;em&gt;more casual&lt;/em&gt; than lounge suiting. And I think we can all learn something from that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly, I'm going to focus on the fact that eveningwear is flashy, the sense in which it signals a partying mood, and sense in which it relates to and echoes loungewear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Daniel-Craig.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Daniel Craig as James Bond.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="eveningwearisflashy"&gt;Eveningwear is flashy.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lounge suit is generally composed of matte wool or some other material with no more than a minimal sheen. It generally has notch lapels and horn buttons. You wear it with a buttoned shirt, calfskin leathers, and often a belt. It's generally built to help you look good, but blend in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on a tuxedo, the lapels are covered in satin or grosgrain. It has peak or shawl lapels for the grabbing of attention. The buttons are covered in felt or silk or something similarly smooth. You wear a shirt with a covered placket, a bow tie, and a waist covering to ensure that there is no white interruption below the button point, as opposed to a belt that would constitute such an interruption. Your footwear is either the eye-grabbing patent leather or velvet -- you're trying to exude luxury. Everything about eveningwear demands attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially evident in events with creative black tie dress codes; while peoples' lounge suits are rarely loud, the second you lift the strict limits of black tie, people get &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Luka-Sabbat-Met-Gala-2018.jpg" width="1080" height="1620" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Ansel-Elgort-Met-Gala-2018.jpg" width="1080" height="1651" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Chadwick-Boseman-Met-Gala-2018.jpg" width="1080" height="1720" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Donald-Glover-Met-Gala-2018.jpg" width="1080" height="1625" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luka Sabbat, Ansel Elgort, Chadwick Boseman and Donald Glover, all at the Met Gala 2018. Sorry, creative black tie events are few and far between these days, and this was one of the better-photographed events. Well, Luka's photo appears to have been taken before the event, but that's what he wore.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when you want to expand your casual wardrobe, consider, using flashier elements -- silk, or its more manageable cousin rayon. Velvet and other pile fabrics. Anything with an unusual sheen. Think about whether, and in what ways, you want to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="youwearabusinesssuitforbusinessyouweareveningweartoparty"&gt;You wear a business suit for business. You wear eveningwear to party.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to a wedding in the same suit you wear for an interview, you're going to look the way you look in an interview. You're going to look like you're there to do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tuxedo stands out, not just because it's flashy, but because it's unusual. Nobody wears a tuxedo to the office. Nobody wears a tuxedo to a grocery store. If you see somebody in a tuxedo, you know he's there to party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, even when the jacket comes off, and you're in a bow tie and suspenders, you don't look like Steve Urkel -- you still look like you were born on the dance floor. At some point in the night, you'll undo the bowtie, grab a whiskey or a cigar, and feel like you're in The Godfather. The whole rig just represents this classic, romantic, perfect ideal of man at his best and happiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Sebastian-McFox.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B73A815BLy4"&gt;Sebastian McFox&lt;/a&gt; via Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Donald-Glover-Gucci-Emmys-2017.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Donald Glover at the 2017 Emmy Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;So don't just think about your occasion in terms of how formal it is, but what the spirit is. Is it a serious occasion, or a fun one? Are you here to work -- whether in business casual or workwear and denim -- or to chill, or to party? Each of these mindsets can be explored through suiting or more casual attire, and is important to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="tuxedosarelinkedtoclassicloungewear"&gt;Tuxedos are linked to classic loungewear.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare the Dinner Jacket to the Smoking Jacket; compare the Smoking Jacket to the Dressing Gown. Compare Prince Albert slippers to Smoking slippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's this whole subclass of high-end luxury loungewear -- clothing that's practically similar to black tie, but meant to be worn by either wealthy or unreasonably proper men, exclusively in their homes. It's the kind of thing you'd wear if you threw a house party and wanted to feel just a little bit like Hugh Heffner -- just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice soft shawl lapel helps echo this vibe more, where a peak lapel will better reflect the formal spirit you're probably still grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/04/Mathias-Lefevre.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How Formal is Formalwear?"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6s7hDJg616/"&gt;Mathias le Fèvre&lt;/a&gt; via Instagram. Also consider the Luka Sabbat look from above.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might you dress this down from a full tuxedo, but up from actual loungewear? A belt or tie can also be very helpful. A shawl collar cardigan can be soft; a silky noragi might flow in the way you want it to. Velvet, again, can work nicely. Your shoes should be slip ons, maybe suede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world gets more casual, we see fewer and fewer black tie dress codes. People have small daytime weddings in lounge suits. And by all means -- do what you want, especially at your wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think we're missing something. I think we're giving up a dress code that isn't old and stuffy -- like I believe White Tie and Morning Dress to be -- but sleek and fun in all the best ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's expensive, and we don't want to expect our guests to spend a few hundred dollars on a creative black tie rig here and there. Black Tie Optional is a good middle ground, but it's a bit of a schizophrenic dress code since eveningwear and lounge suits feel so different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don't think we're about to see an eveningwear revival. But if we could reimagine it as something more accessible, the spirit of eveningwear is an important one I think we need to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So consider the principles of casualness embodied here. Consider buying more flashy menswear, silk and velvet -- or perhaps more wearable cousins like rayon and corduroy. Consider pieces that announce your intention to party. Wear suede slippers, or kilim slippers, or belgian loafers. Wear clothing that exhibits comfort -- a silky noragi or a thick, soft, belted, shawl collar cardigan. Wear anything you wouldn't normally wear, and take eveningwear as a bit of inspiration towards that ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

The shirts are fine at bundle prices, but nothing to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey all. No clever intro this time -- &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ"&gt;Twillory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;) just sent me a solid bunch of stuff to review. The shirts and underwear here were all given to me at no cost in consideration of my review. At the bottom, I'll throw in a few shots of my old wool tie from Twillory, which I (kind of) paid for -- more on that further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have some coupons: &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/SUNHR01GR0lDSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;buy one and get one free shirts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.pntra.com/t/SUNISEdHR01DSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;$20 off your first purchase of shirts/pants&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, these don't cover the good shit -- the undertwills -- but they're decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that They didn't ask for any special treatment here, and I ain't givin' it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/Qz9JR0pEP0RCREtESj9JR0pE?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwillory.com%2Fproducts%2Fnon-iron-purple-hayes"&gt;SafeCotton Dress Shirt in &amp;quot;Purple Hayes&amp;quot; Check&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/collections/safecotton/products/non-iron-purple-hayes"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: 100% Cotton Twill&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 15.5/32-33 Tailored Fit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shirts normally go for $99 each, but get much cheaper when you buy 2-4, down as low as $57 each for 4+. I also have a coupon that lets you &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/SUNHR01GR0lDSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;buy one and get one free&lt;/a&gt;, and also there's some kind of free gift involved I don't know anything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fabric is... Different. It's very soft, but sort of... coarse. It's overall nicer than the stiff poplins and twills I have from Charles Tyrwhitt and Bonobos, but I often notice it brush against my skin, and when I do, I'm just not sure how I feel. It reminds me of my wool-blend shirt from Hilditch &amp;amp; Key, except that one is pretty disappointing -- I only wear it with an undershirt -- whereas this fabric is... good, just strange. I'm curious to see how it feels after a few washes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use a different treatment from the typical formaldehyde-based treatment used to make non-iron shirts. They brag about the chemicals they don't use, but there shouldn't be anything particularly dangerous about typical non-iron treatments -- the amount of formaldehyde that might reach even the surface of your skin is pretty negligible -- so they just happen to be doing something a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other details are pretty nice. The collar is a respectable spread. The stitching seems good. The collar stays, while not especially important, are a really nice, thick, brushed nickel, with a pattern engraved on one side. The buttons are a thick plastic resin, which... At these prices, you could start looking for mother of pearl buttons, most notably from Brooks Brothers (who I'd describe as their closest price competitor -- you might have to buy clearance or wait for a sale, but it shouldn't be hard to get 4/$200 shirts from Brooks Brothers). But Mother of Pearl isn't a big deal -- it's more just a classic menswear standard than anything. With the &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/SUNHR01GR0lDSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;bogo+gift coupon&lt;/a&gt;, that's a pretty good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that they offer a lot of interesting patterns, but not a lot of simple ones. I actually couldn't find a solid pale pink shirt on their site, which I think of as a bit of a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes on Sizing: overall fits similar to the equivalent Charles Tyrwhitt, but a little slimmer, as the size charts indicate. But the sleeves are long. I normally go for 32, so I thought 32-33 should be fine, but they're definitely long, probably by more than an inch, on both shirts. Oh well -- for now, I'm wearing sweaters over them anyway, and in spring/summer, I'll probably just roll my sleeves up. I might tailor them, but as for buying more -- sleeve sizing would be a big enough issue to stop me. But sizing is possible, and if you can find a size you like, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll roll them up in the summer and survive.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="2mixerperformancedressshirt"&gt;2. &amp;quot;Mixer&amp;quot; Performance Dress Shirt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twillory.com%2Fcollections%2Fperformance%2Fproducts%2Fperformance-mixer"&gt;Performance Dress shirt in &amp;quot;Mixer&amp;quot; Windowpane&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/collections/performance/products/performance-mixer"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: Roughly 64% Cotton, 21% Spandex, 11% Coolmax (a particular type of Nylon), 4% spandex. Twill weave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 15.5/32-33 Tailored Fit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shirts normally go for $99 each, but get much cheaper when you buy 2-4, down as low as $57 each for 4+. I also have a coupon that lets you &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/SUNHR01GR0lDSEZIT0hOQ0dJRkdJSg"&gt;buy one and get one free&lt;/a&gt;, and also there's some kind of free gift involved I don't know anything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I don't have a lot of experience with performance dress shirts. I'm the type of guy who tends to prefer natural materials, but figured that would be a useful perspective. For more detail, the Kavalier has a review, and also mentions Twillory in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2rb_dixLAQ"&gt;his latest performance dress shirt roundup&lt;/a&gt;. He's a fan, but to be fair, he's a fan of most of the things he's ever been near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as for my perspective... I don't love it. The fabric is stretchy, but it's not soft in the way I expect pure cotton to be. I don't have a particular need for stretch. Maybe it'll prove its value after I throw it in the wash, or in the summer when I can put the breathability to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses the same nice buttons and collar stays as the cotton shirt, and fits the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also added some kind padding to the inside cuffs and part of the back... That actually feels quite nice on my skin, although I don't particularly want the gray contrast showing when I roll my sleeves up.&lt;/p&gt;

Don't worry, I won't be modeling these..&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="3performanceundershirt"&gt;3. Performance Undershirt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twillory.com%2Fcollections%2Fundertwills%2Fproducts%2Fundertwills-performance-vneck"&gt;Performance Undershirt // V Neck&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/collections/undertwills/products/undertwills-performance-vneck"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;) in white.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: 47% Cotton / 47% Rayon / 6% Spandex&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$24 for one, $36 for 2, or &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twillory.com%2Fcollections%2Fundertwills%2Fproducts%2Fperformance-undertwills-4-pack"&gt;$14.50/shirt at 4+&lt;/a&gt;. Can be combo'd with boxer briefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this one, I get. Undershirts, since they're supposed to fit closer to the body, actually need some stretch. And they used rayon! Now rayon feels good on the skin. This undershirt is cool, breathable, and pleasant. It's cut long, so it can stay tucked in, and is just deep enough a v to stay hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two downsides: one, it only comes in white. Gray is generally the least visible color for an undershirt, so that's what I'd prefer. But I haven't actually had an issue with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the price. At $24 per, they're not quite impulse buys. But at the multi-buy price -- $14.50 for 4+ -- I really complain, especially for such a nice fabric blend. I'd say they are a better value than uniqlo airism at that price, but I haven't actually tested them in the heat yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="4performanceboxerbriefs"&gt;4. Performance Boxer Briefs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twillory.com%2Fcollections%2Fundertwills%2Fproducts%2Fundertwills-performance-boxer-briefs-gray"&gt;Performance Boxer Briefs // Grey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.twillory.com/collections/undertwills/products/undertwills-performance-boxer-briefs-gray"&gt;non-tracking link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: 90% modal (which is a type of rayon), 10% spandex&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$24 for one, $36 for 2, or &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUlLRUJHRUdOR01CRkhFRkhJ?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twillory.com%2Fcollections%2Fundertwills%2Fproducts%2Fperformance-undertwills-4-pack"&gt;$14.50/pair at 4+&lt;/a&gt;. Can be combo'd with undershirts. These are also available in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so here's the good shit. My first day in these was fine -- the fabric was nice, but they rode up a bit. But after that, they learned to stay put, and... Oh man, they might as well be silk. Soft and luxurious, but with more stretch and breathability than silk would offer. I mean, I like modal, and I haven't compared this to many of the top competitors in the $24 range, but... Even early on, I can tell, I'm probably going to buy 4 more of these at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These don't have any weird gimmicks like a pouch or whatever, but they have the standard front opening, and that's all I really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried my fair share of cotton options, and performance boxer briefs from Cory Vines (fine, except they don't breathe at all). In the interest of sharing information: reddit has a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8sivft/your_favorite_for_underpants/"&gt;megathread&lt;/a&gt;, and this guy did a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/6piys2/the_ultimate_kinda_boxer_brief_review_saxx/?st=j62ixrd1&amp;amp;sh=4be40aaf"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/6s7w7e/the_ultimate_kinda_boxer_brief_review_part_2/"&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; roundup. But these are relatively new, so it's no surprise they weren't included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look is nothing special, but let's be honest, nobody's looking at my underwear anyway. I'm not a fan of the electric blue branded waistband, but this is kind of a minimal concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Wool-Tie.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="Initial Impressions: Twillory Shirts and Underwear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Wool-Tie-2.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="Initial Impressions: Twillory Shirts and Underwear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Wool-Tie-Back.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="Initial Impressions: Twillory Shirts and Underwear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="bonuswoolherringbonetie"&gt;Bonus: Wool Herringbone Tie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I actually got this tie years back, from the only Sprezzabox I ever got, which I paid a half-fee of $10 for. I wore the socks, and while the tie is definitely a great value for $10 &lt;em&gt;if you want it&lt;/em&gt;, I never really had a good reason to wear a wool tie. And that's why you shouldn't buy boxes! The tie is thick and pleasant to the hand, but I haven't even had the occasion to knot it yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll find the right fit for this one of these days, but in the meantime, here's a photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't seem to make this tie anymore, but I suppose it reflects something about the brand, and who doesn't like a few bonus photos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Quarantine Sales</title><description>I wasn't planning on writing about sales very often, but there are a few going on right now that need to be noted.</description><link>http://localhost:2368/quarantine-sales/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e7557e1dc65ec34ae43348e</guid><category>sales</category><category>dress shoes</category><category>shoes</category><dc:creator>Daniel Hakimi</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 13:57:44 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Being-Happy.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Being-Happy.jpg" alt="Quarantine Sales"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning on writing about sales very often, but there are a few going on right now that need to be noted. This, in addition to the fact that many of you are probably at home right now, bored, itching  to buy something, I figured I'd make a few good retail therapy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these are not especially cheap brands, but they offer good values all around, and rarely offer sales. Also note, in case you're curious, that there are no affiliate links or other incentives here -- I'm recommending them because they're cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="grantstone"&gt;Grant Stone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grantstoneshoes.com/"&gt;Grant Stone&lt;/a&gt; sells cool shoes, boots, and leather goods. Generally, they're on the casual end of what dress shoes are, which is a cool space to be in -- smarter and more interesting than sneakers, but not too sleek to wear with jeans or shorts or whatever. Known for boots, longwings and penny loafers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're having a sitewide sale for... well, not for any particular amount, but every pair of shoes they sell is on sale, and they were all good values to begin with, so pick something you like and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="skoaktiebolaget"&gt;Skoaktiebolaget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know you're part of the menswear crowd when you can spell &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.skoaktiebolaget.com/"&gt;Skoaktiebolaget&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; without looking it up. They sell high end shoes from multiple brands, as well as a few fancy accessories and shoe care products. Again, you'd have a hard time finding a bad deal here, even at regular prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're offering 25% off everything site wide, which is pretty crazy, as they usually only put odd stock on sale, and the brands they carry almost never have sales of their own. Use the code 25off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="nomanwalksalone"&gt;No Man Walks Alone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nomanwalksalone.com/?SID=42e18mnleeav55mgjjj3003k86"&gt;No Man Walks Alone&lt;/a&gt; is a New York based menswear boutique that deals in a hundred awesome different brands. There's a pretty good variety of high end stuff there, and I'm not sure how to describe the casual vibe, so &lt;a href="https://nomanwalksalone.com/portfolio/fw-19-lookbook/"&gt;here's their look book with Alex Delaney from Bon Apetit&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do put things on sale occasionally, and they have a sample sale in NYC most years around late May / early June (ish). However, this is still a pretty great sale; you get 20% off all online orders with the code &amp;quot;staysafe,&amp;quot; plus they're donating 20% of their profits to Meals on Wheels' COVID-19 response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="supplyandadvise"&gt;Supply and Advise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/"&gt;Supply and Advise&lt;/a&gt; is what happens when two great menswear shops crash into one another and explode into a mess of awesome. Their space in Miami is cool; the space downstairs reflects the &amp;quot;Supply&amp;quot; identity with a lot of military-inspired menswear, Engineered Garments, RRL, stuff like that. Go upstairs, and you see what they mean by &amp;quot;Advise.&amp;quot; Drake's, Ring Jacket, and 100 Hands, along with some great whiskey. Pepper in some Aldens, GBV, Sunspel, and, I don't know, everything else you want, and you've got a cool brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So their spring sale gives you 20% off all that good stuff (with the code &amp;quot;spring&amp;quot;). Some of these brands might have gone on sale anyway, but you're not going to be disappointed with anything you get from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still interested, I wrote about them &lt;a href="https://dresscode.danhakimi.com/a-visit-to-supply/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it for now. I'll update this article if I see one or two more noteworthy sales... And if I see a bunch, I'll point that out in some more obvious way. Until then -- feel free to reach out to me for TV recommendations, and stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;

A favorite of /r/malefashionadvice for providing a great value, it comes -- as with any such brand -- with a few compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those compromises is their retail space. If you've heard of people in NYC living in closets and shoeboxes, you might understand this. Kent Wang's &amp;quot;store&amp;quot; is only open two days a week, and only by appointment. It's not listed in its building's floor directory, so I had to call up to figure out what floor it's on -- I'm sorry to say that I've since forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friendly salesman named Aaron opened the door, welcoming me into a room they share with another brand, separated by a divider -- the cheap kind, not the fake wall of a flex. And it's about the size of a larger-than-average walk-in closet. The floors are crude and unfinished, as you'll see, and there aren't too many places to sit. But I didn't mind, really. I wasn't there for the ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the things we do to look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Pocket-Squares-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Pocket-Squares-2.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pocket Squares&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/pocket-squares"&gt;pocket squares&lt;/a&gt; are a selling point for the brand. Although I only bought a plain white linen square myself ($20), I've often found myself enamored with their patterned squares (generally $45, generally silk). I'll close off this article with a few instagram posts showing them off -- something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron actually offered to sell me his own Rose Window pocket square, since they didn't have a regular one in stock. That's a cool move, Aaron, even if you will just get another one for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Gloves-and-Cardigans.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gloves and Knitwear&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/misc/gloves"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt; were also great. Deerskin with Cashmere Lining. Really solid option there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then... The &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/outerwear/shawl-cardigan-cream.html"&gt;shawl cardigan&lt;/a&gt; (which is inexplicably in the outerwear section of their website). This is one of the pieces I really wanted to try out, but in person, it really didn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations. It was a warmer, yellower tone than any of the photography showed. It was a full size smaller than you could reasonably expect -- definitely size up. And the material was itchy and just... not very pleasant. I guess it must break in. I'm sure some people would appreciate it, but it was not for me, so the main lesson here is just: Try things on before you buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Watches-Sunglasses-Chopsticks-1.jpg" width="1080" height="810" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Watches-Candles-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Watches, Sunglasses, Candles, and Chopsticks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/misc/watches"&gt;Watches&lt;/a&gt;! I've had my eye on their Bauhaus watches (left) for a while. They're nice mechanical/automatic watches for $350-$400. Well-designed. The Art Deco watch (right, $450) is less my speed, but might be right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses/sunglasses-keyhole.html"&gt;Keyhole Sunglasses&lt;/a&gt; ($55 for acetate, $150 for horn) are pretty cool. They're a point of pride for the brand, and at those prices, they really should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have candles and &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/misc/fragrance"&gt;fragrances&lt;/a&gt; from Jardin de France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they have thick &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/misc/dinnerware/ebony-chopsticks.html"&gt;ebony chopsticks&lt;/a&gt; at $5 a pair. I almost bought two, but this was their only pair in stock, and I was looking for a set I could share with a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Dress-Shoes.jpg" width="1080" height="810" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Sneakers.jpg" width="1080" height="810" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dress shoes and sneakers. NOte the stain on the right side of the floor. They're not focusing on presentation here. They're banking on the theory that quality speaks for itself.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dress shoes seemed pretty nice at a glance. Some cool antiquing effects. The sneakers were nice too, although rumor has it that they come with the stink of a thousand leather goods, and retain that stink for months, so I'm looking elsewhere for sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Fabric-Books.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fabric books&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here's a great reason to go in person: they have an extremely large number of fabrics and linings to choose from. Like, more than you see here. A huge portion of their office is just piles and piles of fabric books for your perusal. On top of the old standards, I really enjoyed the Drago fabrics. Their lining options didn't just include the standard solid bembergs, but a variety of materials, subtle patterns, wacky patterns, cultural references, pieces of art, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another customer was there with me -- I was there early, and his appointment ran long -- and I heard him going over his options. They offer way more customization than other MTM shops. A few stood out -- I believe they mentioned four different pocket width options, which... I can see why I would want that, but I might not ever have thought to ask. So that was pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do fully canvassed MTM suits and half canvassed outerwear at great prices. But you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Mannequin.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Visit to Kent Wang in New York City"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Grenadines!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/ties/grenadine"&gt;Grenadine Ties&lt;/a&gt; for $75. Grenadine ties are a really cool weave that provides texture that can make a solid color interesting. They also have &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/ties/ancient-madder"&gt;Ancient Madders&lt;/a&gt; for $75 and &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/ties/six-fold"&gt;Sixfold Ties&lt;/a&gt; for $85. These are more really solid prices.&lt;/p&gt;

The Dendera zodiac is a bas-relief ceiling from the temple of Hathor in Dendera, Egypt. Based on the position of the stars, paleoastronomers have determined that it dates from 30 BC–30 AD, during the Late Period of ancient Egypt. Both Mesopotamian and Egyptian sky iconography are elegantly combined in the composition. . The central disc represents the celestial realm which include Ursa Major, the great bear, and Tauret, the pregnant hippo-lion goddess. Another ring of figures outside of these circumpolar star groups depict Greco-Roman astrological signs such as the Ram, Lion, Bull, and Scorpion. Around the rim of the sky disc, Decans or &amp;#39;hour stars&amp;#39; used to track time appear above the horizon at dawn. Outside of the sky disc, four pairs of falcon-headed gods and four priestesses from the Temple of Isis are shown holding the heavens above the earth. . The Dendera zodiac is on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris, and has lost its original painted decoration. Ken Bakeman has researched and meticulously redrawn the design, adding color in keeping with the vision of the original Egyptian artists. . . . #kentwang #pocketsquare #pocketsquares #rakish #rakishgent #gentlemenstyle #classicmenswear #stylishmen #menstailoring #stylishgent #sartorial #madetobeworn #styleforum #dandystyle #mnswr #ptoman #mensweardaily #mensjackets #dapper #dappered #sprezzatura #style #stylish #fashion #menstyle #mensfashion #menswear #menwithclass #menwithstyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kent.wang/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"&gt; Kent Wang&lt;/a&gt; (@kent.wang) on &lt;time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2019-10-15T12:02:48+00:00"&gt;Oct 15, 2019 at 5:02am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Illustrated by Jed Henry as part of his Ukiyo-e Heroes series. . The top cartouche phonetically reads &amp;#34;Ma-ri-o&amp;#34;, and the bottom cartouche means &amp;#34;Beloved friends, dear rivals&amp;#34;. . The design of Bowser is based on the legendary dragon turtle from Chinese mythology, a chimeric creature with the body of a turtle and the head of a dragon. Later period ukiyo-e artists such Utagawa Kuniyoshi often depicted such monsters and anthropomorphic creatures in their fantastical woodblock prints. Jed now brings this millennia-old motif full circle by merging 19th century Japanese woodblocks with 20th century video games. .

&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Peacoat-and-Tie-Cover-1.jpg" alt="Initial Impressions, Collected: Asket OCBD, Vintage Brooks Brothers Tie, Saks Pea Coat"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand: Asket&lt;br&gt;
Item: &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/shop/shirts/oxford-shirt-white"&gt;Oxford Shirt, White&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Size: Medium Short&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I received this shirt at no cost in consideration of my review. Regular price for this shirt is $105.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it! It's a nice oxford -- a little stiff for now. but it'll soften up over time. It weighs in at 175gsm, which, as I understand it, is substantial but not heavy for an oxford. The collar roll is not especially intense, but that's just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of details, we have a back center pleat and a button on the back of the collar. The buttons are Mother of Pearl,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hem is good for wearing untucked, which is good, because it comes in a short length!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the length -- the sleeves aren't quite short enough for me, and while fit is personal, this brings up one issue with these shirts... At $105 US, they're competing with Made to Measure shirting. I'm really excited to have a shirt that fits me relatively well off the rack, and it's definitely a nice shirt, but if I factor in tailoring, it's &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive than made to measure options, and that's a tough pill to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to mention, again -- although I imagine many of you have heard me talk about it by now -- that Asket is a super ethical brand. They offer traceability and transparency into their processes, so you can understand, better than with most companies, just how they treat their workers and how sustainable their practices are. They promote proper garment care, and use minimal packaging, and do a lot of other little things that really signal their intent to be good corporate citizens. That's worth a few points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full review to come after I've had it tailored and actually worn it well.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the colors look relatively good in these photos... Honestly, none of them do it justice.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="2vintagebrooksbrothersancientmadderpaisleytiefromluxeswap"&gt;2. Vintage Brooks Brothers Ancient Madder Paisley Tie from LuxeSwap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand: Brooks Brothers&lt;br&gt;
Purchased on auction from &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/balearic1/m.html?_nkw=&amp;amp;_armrs=1&amp;amp;_ipg=&amp;amp;_from="&gt;Luxeswap on eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this tie. The colors are beautiful and hard to capture on camera. There's not too much to review, but there's plenty to talk about...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's untipped. In case you don't know what that means... A tie has two kinds of lining. The first is the interlining, which is the thickish stuff in the middle of the tie that isn't just a thin layer of silk, which allows you to tie  it without crushing it and get a decent knot. The second is regular lining -- &amp;quot;untipped&amp;quot; means it does not have that lining, so if you look at the back tip of the tie, you just see the same layer of fabric on the front, and it's super light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's an ancient madder. And again, in case you don't know what that means: madder is a type of dye that creates really cool colors, but silk doesn't normally take very nicely to it... Unless you strip the natural coating from the silk, dye it in that raw form, and coat it again with gum arabic, creating a unique look and feel. Not a lot of brands still do this, so the effect is pretty unique and special. You might have to see one of these in person to really appreciate the depth of the colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying vintage accessories is cool. Aside from being super sustainable, good vintage clothing can be very well-made. And with accessories, there's relatively little risk that you get something that  This one is a little short, but it's well made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally... &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/balearic1/m.html?_nkw=&amp;amp;_armrs=1&amp;amp;_ipg=&amp;amp;_from="&gt;Luxeswap&lt;/a&gt;! You should buy things from Luxeswap. They auction off high-end menswear, and while many well-dressed men know about them, their auction prices still often end up being better than the prices you'd find on Grailed or TheRealReal. Just remember: patience is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-container"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-row"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Saks-Peacoat-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1440" alt="Initial Impressions, Collected: Asket OCBD, Vintage Brooks Brothers Tie, Saks Pea Coat"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-gallery-image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/03/Saks-Peacoat-Details-1.jpg" width="1080" height="810" alt="Initial Impressions, Collected: Asket OCBD, Vintage Brooks Brothers Tie, Saks Pea Coat"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Again, I struggled to capture the color here. But here, it's because the color is constantly changing in person. Sometimes it's redder, sometimes it's purpler, sometimes it's even a little brownish.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="3saksfifthavenuepeacoat"&gt;3. Saks Fifth Avenue Pea Coat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: Saks Fifth Avenue&lt;br&gt;
Purchased for $95 from a Prive / Brunello Cucinelli sample sale. No materials tag or size tag or anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Color&lt;/strong&gt;: Idk, purpleish? Burgunplum? Red Wine Sangria? It changes colors in different lighting, come up with your own names for it and @ me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coat is... not especially good. Barely any lining, which means it's not very warm. And the fabric... isn't bad, but I suspect there's some polyamide or something else other than wool in here. Machined buttonholes, including a sealed lapel buttonhole. Non-functional buttonholes on the arm. The buttons are thick and colorful, but they might be acetate or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that... It doesn't fit especially well. It's a size big in every dimension I can fit a blazer under it, which, for a pea coat, is kind of incorrect -- pea coats are relatively casual. I can wear a thick cardigan under it too, or just accept that it's a loose fit, but there's nothing fantastic about the drape either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I love the color. And I wanted something double breasted to play with. And for $95... this thing is fine. I'll wear it through a good chunk of spring, and probably keep wearing it over superior outerwear just because of the color. Which kinda goes to show you... if it looks good, it looks good, and the abstract ideal of quality doesn't always need to override that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, I think it's &lt;a href="https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/saks-fifth-avenue-collection-double-breasted-peacoat/product/0400011154846"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but in a different color.

The most fantastical unbelievable ridiculous holiday of the four-ish-year-cycle. And one of the biggest fashion opportunities of the year! While you're munching away at your rhubarb, consider these trends and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id="general-principles"&gt;General Principles&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, and most important, &lt;strong&gt;nothing that happens on Leap Day counts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That means you can spend as much money as you want, and, legally, your credit card company can't make you pay it off. (This is not legal advice).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This also means that you can dress in the most ridiculous bullshit you can think of, and, if it doesn't look good, oh well! It's Leap Day! Real life is for March!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leap Day is usually cold, so you'll generally want to layer up in warm clothing. Or not, it's Leap Day, do whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally -- and this should be obvious -- wear blue and yellow, unless you want to get poked in the eye.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So -- we're looking for loud, expensive pieces you've been wanting for the past four years, ideally in blue and yellow.

Delugs Watch Strap in Navy Shell Cordovan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/02/stack-angle-cover.jpg" alt="Initial Impressions, Collected -- Delugs Watch Strap, Asket Tee Shirt, Kent Wang Pocket Square"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://delugs.com/"&gt;Delugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://delugs.com/collections/shell-cordovan-signature/products/navy-shell-cordovan-signature-watch-strap"&gt;Navy Shell Cordovan&lt;/a&gt; from Shinki Hikaku&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Small length, 20mm lug width&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customizations&lt;/strong&gt;: White Contrast Stitching&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price Paid&lt;/strong&gt;: $80 shipped (Black Friday sale)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I can get a good leather belt from Meermin for $50. So I told myself, I should be able to find a quality leather watch strap that isn't &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; casual for less than that, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, wrong. After a lot of searching, I came to a realization. The materials don't really cost anything. It's just the labor you're paying for, and stitching a watch strap well takes mroe labor than putting a belt together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delugs offers a ton of customization. By default, you can select length of both sides and lug width, but you can write your own sizes in, and request contrast stitching. They offer a lot of different kinds of leathers, including weird stuff like stingray. They also have those metal slidey things that make it easy to attach and detach the straps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this one. I'm no expert on watch straps, and while I'm starting to suspect the white stitching makes it more casual than I was hoping, it still looks great to my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the man behind the brand is pretty great. He's super responsive on Instagram and actually let me make a modification there after ordering, but before he started work on it. It did take more than a month, but that was understandable -- he sold a lot during his black friday sale, and he works alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strap was a little stiff when I got it, but it softened up nicely in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

Asket T-Shirt in Navy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/"&gt;Asket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Item&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/shop/t-shirts/t-shirt-dark-navy"&gt;T-Shirt, Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium Short&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I received this T-shirt at no cost in consideration of my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing is, basically, one gigantic environmental disaster. And they say sunlight is the best disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this tee is nice. I don't want to be a $45-tee kind of guy, but it is definitely a significant upgrade from my Uniqlo Supima Cotton tee. But I'll discuss that more specifically in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, it's really worth noting the premise of this brand. Asket doesn't just make quality basics. Asket does it &lt;em&gt;ethically&lt;/em&gt;. Now, I don't normally like to talk about ethics in menswear, because it's usually a flood of marketing jargon, greenwashing, and an occasional side of xenophobia. Asket isn't about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asket provides as much traceability and price transparency as it can. For the T-Shirt, that's only 68% traceability -- still a far cry better than most brands -- but they aspire to 100%, and get closer with items like their &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/shop/shirts/oxford-shirt-white"&gt;Oxford Shirt&lt;/a&gt; (86% traceable). And they tell you where everything came from and where everything was made. Not just the shirt fabric, but the threads used to make the hem, neck, and armholes, and the polyester used to make the brand and materials tags. That's pretty hardcore. They also tell you what it cost them. Now, $45 for a tee shirt that cost $13 to make might not be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; exciting (it's probably the kind of markup many brands charge on sale), but the transparency is. (I also think the &amp;quot;traditional retail&amp;quot; estimate is a little bit of a marketing shenanigan, but I'll indulge them that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this transparency so great? Because it allows you to make real, informed decisions about the environmental and human impact of your purchase. And it helps us make sure that they don't use slave labor, which, in 2020, is an unreasonably common and complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also do a lot of other small things. Like small/minimal packaging (but not so tight as to make the tee shirt wrinkle, the lines smoothed out pretty easy for me). And their whole collection being full of basics means none of their stock ever has to sit dead in a warehouse -- nothing goes to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, they put a stress on proper &lt;a href="https://www.asket.com/garment-care/"&gt;garment care&lt;/a&gt;. They offer garment brushes and delicate detergents. They want your clothing to last, even though that means fewer sales for them -- because the best thing for the environment is to buy less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing I want to restate -- they have short and long sizes! I don't like to review fit, since it's very specifically personal, but you can't complain about additional options. Very few brands offer tall and short sizes, and Bonobos' quality isn't anything to write home about, so if you're a tricky fit, get excited!&lt;/p&gt;

Kent Wang White Linen Pocket Square&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kentwang.com/pocket-squares/linen/linen-white.html"&gt;Kent Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Material&lt;/strong&gt;: Linen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, it's not just a linen pocket square... It's a nice one. Soft. Pleasant. Bigger than I expected. I feel like I've read somewhere that the difference between a pocket square and handkercheif is size, but I feel like I'll hate myself a little bit more if I look that up, so... It's a big pocket square. There's got to be a limit to my fashion nerding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linen is a voluminous material, and given the size of this thing, even a TV fold (the boring one) takes up some space in your pocket. If your jacket is slim in the chest, this might actually affect fit, drape, and symmetry. So be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, their other linen squares seemed smaller, and the silk ones are definitely safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Last&lt;/strong&gt;: Beat (you haven't heard of this last. I'll get into that).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Color&lt;/strong&gt;: Dark Brown&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Soles&lt;/strong&gt;: Leather&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt;: Goodyear Welt, Moccasin-style Lasting&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Horsebit&lt;/strong&gt;: Nickel&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $95 shipped for seconds at acution. Presumably $195 + shipping if they were firsts, although they can no longer be purcased. Yes, I know, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box contained the shoes and one dust bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="buyingprocess"&gt;Buying Process&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meermin's seconds store is a strange place. They ship from Spain, and that costs $35. And their shoes, belts, and wallets are very reasonably priced to begin with. So you have to bid unreasonably low numbers to actually get a deal -- if you bid, say, $120, which you might say is roughly the right price for a pair of Meermin seconds, you'll find yourself paying $155, at which point you might as well go to their NYC store and buy firsts. It's stranger with belts: bidding starts at $10, and first belts go for $50 without tax in state, so if you bid more than $15, you're overpaying! And auctions last 3 days, so you don't have much time to decide how much you want the pair you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I swear, I've seen people pay more for Meermin seconds than firsts. So I spent quite some time looking through the store at my small size, often making lowball bids. Eventually, I fell ass-backwards into this pair. I knew they were bit loafers, but didn't really understand the history behind them, moccasin construction, or anything like that. But after I won my first pair of Meermins... Boy, did I get into some research. That's about the time I wrote &lt;a href="https://dresscode.danhakimi.com/how-to-talk-about-loafers/"&gt;How to Talk About Loafers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took a couple of weeks to ship from Spain. Patience is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, for normal purchases, Meermin's returns process is not especially friendly, so it's always better to buy in store, or at least try on your size in store. Otherwise, you'll probably be on the hook for shipping each way. That's not ideal. As a general tip -- my size is a 6.5 US in some lasts, and a 7uk in others. I usually wear about a 7.5 US in most dress shoes. But my feeet are strange, and guessing is never a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

What is wrong with these shoes? Nothing I could spot. The seam around the front strikes me as more &amp;quot;imperfect because it's handmade&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;unbecoming of a proper shoe brand.&amp;quot; Maybe I'm just not picky enough, but I couldn't figure out the problem. So score one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they fit! I had never tried on the beat last -- it doesn't entirely exist, and the Meermin store in NYC hadn't opened yet -- so... They were on the tight side, but I had to celebrate this fact. They fit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="breakingthemin"&gt;Breaking Them In&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meermin has a notorious break in period, and, again, these were on the tight side. It doesn't help that I once attended to wear them with a pair of no-show socks that was just a little too-low-cut -- that was a painful learning experience. But eventually, the break-in was over, and now, I can safely say that these are comfortable-ish. I mean, they won't win any comfortable awards, but I'm not opposed to putting them on, and for a dress shoe at this price tier, that's a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="oneofsomesmallnumber"&gt;One of... Some small number.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've never seen these, before, have you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of Meermin's Beat last? Can you find info about it... anywhere? The searches I run only seem to result in posts I've made, so if anybody else has gotten a pair of these, that person is not the type to write about them online. At least not in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, a &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; is basically the thing that gives the shoe its shape. For those who knew that: the Beat last is a little different. Normally, a shoe is lasted by stretching the leather over the last into the shape of a shoe's upper. But the Beat last is a moccasin last, and moccasins are lasted differently. The leather is stretched up from the bottom, and sewn at that big chunky seam you see, cradling the foot in a soft, round layer of leather. Native Americans wore shoes made like this as soft-soled moccasins to move through forests easily. Then Aurland Shoes came and threw on a rigid sole and heel, transforming the moccasin into one of the first ever loafers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moccasin-style loafers are usually more casual, but for reasons I get into in &lt;a href="https://dresscode.danhakimi.com/how-to-talk-about-loafers/"&gt;How to Talk About Loafers&lt;/a&gt;, the moccasin-style horsebit loafer is unusually versatile, valid even with a suit. They contrast starkly with the &lt;a href="https://meermin.com/in_en/10167010190000se-19-101670-black-calf-e-negro.html"&gt;apron toe loafers here&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite the relatively thick handsewn seam, are relatively sleek, and almost feminine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shoes were apparently once available on Meermin's website, but as far as I'm concerned, they're one of one. And you can get an MTO, but short of going bespoke, you don't have a shoe with a unique last. And I do. That's really cool. (If you have a pair of shoes in this last, please reach out -- we'll start a club).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this makes this review a little silly. You can't buy these shoes, or anything like them to the point where telling you how great they are is useful. I can tell you that Meermin is a great company selling great shoes for a great price... But they're not selling these. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

I like these shoes. I'm very happy with them. I've come into the horsebit loafer style -- I think of them as statement pieces, but they are also the traditional footwear of the land I come from -- the West Egg of Long Island, now home of my Persian brethren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relax, I'm not wearing these with an Hermes belt or an unearned belief that everybody I meet has seen the face of God. But I am wearing them every-which way I can. With cropped chinos, with a suit, with shorts. With boring dress socks, with fun ones, with no-shows. To work, to bars, to house parties. With brown, and with gray. Yes, they were part of the inspiration for the first piece I wrote for this blog: &lt;a href="https://dresscode.danhakimi.com/versatile-but-not-minimal/"&gt;Versatile, but not Minimal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they're compliment-getters. Whether I'm out in the real world or home in Great Neck, these things grab the eye and earn that attention the right way. I'm happy for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color is a mid-dark brown, with some reddish tones in the right lighting. The bit is nickel, which I find much more palatable than the usually garish gold tones. I'm not sure how I'll maintain the metal long term -- any tips on that would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for comfort: the soles are not especially flexible -- a limitation of the goodyear welt -- but they're fine. The uppers are not especially soft -- not compared to my more expensive J. FitzPatricks, at least, they compare favorably to everything else in my closet -- but for $200, they're really fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, better than fine. Take a look at the photos. I've had these shoes for about 22 months. And while I haven't worn them &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many times, I haven't babied them either. You can barely tell, from the uppers, that they've been worn. I haven't even bothered to polish them yet, because... Again, aside from some edge dressing, they don't need it. They've been brushed on occasion and conditioned a few times, but have otherwise gotten no special treatment. The soles have weathered a few long days in and around New York City, including rainy days (when I was afraid to wear some other shoes that would not have held up as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about Meermin's quality construction and materials elsewhere. You'll read very good things. These shoes will last me a lifetime with a small number of resoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... I like these shoes. Would I pay full price for them now? Probably, yeah. Would I recommend Meermin at $195? This is not a proper hypothetical -- I recommend them constantly, on reddit and to my friends in person. A few have taken me up on it. One friend spoke highly of them ater break in, before he regressed to Cole Haan, citing comfort concerns, but remember that Cole Haan glues poor leather uppers to poor soles to make generally ugly and overpriced shoes. Another saves his tan wholecuts for when he needs a compliment -- and they, too, deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, for those who are skimming: I'm very happy with these shoes, and would wholeheartedly recommend future purchases from Meermin. They use great leather and quality construction to deliver quality dress shoes at a remarkably low price. They're not especially comfortable, but after a break-in, they're about what you'd expect. The styling on this pair, as with most shoes they make, is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend care in sizing, particularly if you cannot get to their store, but I'd generally recommend that no matter who you're buying from. It's just slightly more noteworthy here due to the shipping expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, I won these shoes at auction. I have no relationship with Meermin, aside from occasional visits to their store and compliments paid to the employees working there. I'm only telling you good things because I think those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go out there and get yourself a pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm sorry to be telling you about something you can't buy. But here are some alternatives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apron toe -- more common, sleeker, sometimes feminine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://meermin.com/in_en/10167010190000se-19-101670-black-calf-e-negro.html"&gt;Meermin Hiro Last&lt;/a&gt; (or Made to Order -- you might get them to recreate this shoe if they still have the beat last on hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jfitzpatrickfootwear.com/collections/boutique/products/pike-copper-museum-calf-presale"&gt;J. FitzPatrick Pike&lt;/a&gt; -- currently on sale for a steal at $295. Let him know Dan Hakimi sent you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-loafers/horsebit-loafers-navy-cordovan-80643"&gt;Carmina Uetam Last&lt;/a&gt; -- this pair is in navy shell, so it's a little more expensive, but they make cheaper ones too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moc Toe -- less common, uniquely versatile, not sleek at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GH Bass (&lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/Qz9JREZHP0RCREtESj9JREZH?website=308802&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghbass.com%2Fproduct%2Flincoln%2Beasy%2Bweejuns.do%3Flocale%3Dus"&gt;Affiliate Link&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.ghbass.com/product/lincoln+easy+weejuns.do?selectedOption=567924"&gt;Regular Link&lt;/a&gt;) -- not exactly quality footwear (unimpressive leather, cemented soles), but they look good enough, have a pretty rich history, and can be found on sale. A good way to test out the style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beckett Simonon Beaumont (&lt;a href="https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/beaumont-horsebit-loafers?rfsn=3353795.2c9040&amp;amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;amp;variant=29707534336079"&gt;Referral Link&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/beaumont-horsebit-loafers?variant=29707534336079"&gt;(Regular Link&lt;/a&gt;) -- a little squarer than I'd like, but here's where the quality starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-loafers/horsebit-loafers-brown-funchal-80746"&gt;Carmina Xim Last&lt;/a&gt; -- see, I told you. $330 for carminas is a great deal. I don't believe the Xim last is a true moccasin last, but it looks close enough to me. This would probably be my pick today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/pr/men/shoes-for-men/moccasins-and-loafers-for-men/1953-horsebit-leather-loafer-p-307929BLM001000?position=47&amp;amp;listName=ProductGrid&amp;amp;categoryPath=Men/Shoes-for-Men/Moccasins-and-Loafers-for-Men"&gt;Gucci 1953&lt;/a&gt; -- named for the year they invented the horsebit loafer, and in the original style (black calf, gold horsebit, moc toe). You're paying a little more here for the brand and for history, but they're still excellent shoes, and the price isn't &lt;em&gt;exorbitant&lt;/em&gt; -- this is a perfectly valid purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first fell in love with belted coats, and I had to ask what they were called -- they're called &amp;quot;belted&amp;quot; coats. And belted cardigans. These items have a belt attached to the body, like a bath robe might, usually in the same material as the body material. This is not just an extra accessory; it allows you to play with the piece's silhouette, obtaining some benefits of both slim and full cuts. A cinched waist can do the same thing, shaping a garment in fantastic ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to explore why I love belted coats and cinched waists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overview: a belt closure, unlike buttons and zippers, is inherently adjustable, giving you breathing room if you gain or lose weight, but also if you decide to wear a thick layer underneath, or just wear the coat over a tee shirt.It also makes it simple to close the coat, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tightly, giving you one garment with multiple silhouette options. You can also, obviously, tie different knots, leave the coat open, with or without the belt, or in some cases, button the coat, making belted outerwear incredibly versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, an overcoat is a structured garment. There's a specific series of buttoning points, there's structure in the sholders, the lapels stay put, and you look like you're wearing a softer suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A belt lets you mix things up. Instead of wearing the coat according to the rules, bury yourself in the coat like you would bury yourself in a blanket, and instead of fiddling with buttons, lazily tie it up into whatever seems like a knot to your hands at the time. Get a fabric that drapes in cool ways, and it'll flow around you in ways that simultaneously look and feel &lt;em&gt;super cozy&lt;/em&gt;. You want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a &lt;a href="https://dieworkwear.com/post/188593573349/the-other-kind-of-slip-on"&gt;raglan sleeve overcoat&lt;/a&gt; for even less of a structured look.&lt;/p&gt;

Most are belted, but I really love the cinched waist on the Stoffa coat. As I mentioned before, they look great with a tie, but also dressed down, as they get a bit of the blanket vibe from the overcoat. They also look great in visibly soft materials like suede, corduroy, and linen.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dressing-gown/"&gt;dressing gown&lt;/a&gt; is not something you'd want to wear outside, but perhaps you want to replicate certain features to acheive &lt;a href="http://usuallywhatimdressed.in/inspiration/lazy-luxury/"&gt;lazy luxury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A noragi approximates some of the same vibes while being a lot more acceptable to wear outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A belt or cinched waist can also help with parkas and leather jackets, as you will see in my full album below -- justifying a fuller cut that can fit over whatever you want to wear under it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a belt or cinch allows you to play with one piece as though it was twelve, and have a lot of fun doing it. Consider one for your next piece of outerwear. Or cardigan. Or noragi. Or... Well, I won't begrudge you if you get them all.&lt;/p&gt;

Grey chinos. Dark wash jeans. White and light blue button ups. Minimal white sneakers, CP-style. Gray and navy overcoats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that what versatility is really about? For me, a key part of versatility is being able to wear something in casual, business casual, and somewhat more formal contexts. It also helps to have neutral colors and other details that pair well with a variety of options, but &lt;em&gt;minimalism&lt;/em&gt; isn't actually required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And versatility isn't just a nice idea. It allows you to invest more in a smaller number of higher-quality pieces, which is always a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you move from a &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; wardrobe to a more mature one, you will want some more unique pieces that stand out, or help you stand out. In this article, I intend to explore a few ways you might choose to build on your basic wardrobe while still keeping each piece versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1953, Aldo Gucci had a weird fucking idea. The history of menswear has always been linked to horseback riding, but he wanted to try something new. He took a metal horse bit—the thing they put into a horse's mouth to make sure it turns when you pull at the harness (yes, this is kind of horrible)—and he put it on a loafer. The original—a moccasin-style loafer in black calf with gold hardware—was an instant hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, a moccasin-style loafer is generally a very casual dress shoe. But the bit loafer was an expensive shoe in 1953, when the wealthy men were mostly white bankers and stuff like that—the types of men who wore suits. So that's how it was worn, and it's maintained a niche there as a different way to take any suit and make it a little bit flashier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they still work great with shorts! See &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/DjxdOen"&gt;this pair&lt;/a&gt; in suede from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Obcdmeme/"&gt;/u/Obcdmeme/&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/hLF7sHK"&gt;these Carminas&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nipplemonger"&gt;/u/nipplemonger&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is an apron toe and a sleek last, but it still works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I own the above Meermins in brown calf, and I love them. They're a statement piece, but one I'm never afraid to wear to work, to parties, on the weekend... I can wholeheartedly recommend bit loafers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing with texture is fun. Corduroy is chino's softer, tufted cousin, with a striped wale texture. It's velvet, except much more wearable and easier to maintain. And although denim, chino, and wool are treated as the most basic and common trouser materials, there's nothing Corduroy can't do. I'm generally recommending &amp;quot;corduroys&amp;quot;—that is to say, corduroy trousers—but of course, these are just ideas, and a corduroy jacket or shirt might take you far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress it up with soft tailoring, or down with knitwear or a flannel. Pair it with suede. Seek inspiration from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thisishirokisamerica"&gt;/u/thisishirokisamerica&lt;/a&gt;, who made two inspo albums on the material—&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/0rEcDeR"&gt;CorduRoy G. Biv&lt;/a&gt;, organized by color, and &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/Cu4hN7r"&gt;Corduroy Boy But Make It Spring/Summer&lt;/a&gt;. It's no wonder reddit has fallen in love with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just choose your pair carefully. Color is the obvious factor: corduroy takes on color well, enabling things like a bright orange, but an orange pair might be less versatile than a navy blue. But also consider pocket layout. Slant pockets are probably more versatile, whereas the five-pocket layout forces a casual appearance. It might also be worth considering wale width. Trousers generally use a wider wale, and jackets and shirts a narrower wale, but again, this is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that warning, I arm you with knowledge: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ay06yb/your_favorite_for_corduroy_pants/"&gt;use these brand recommendations wisely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safari jacket can, likewise, be dressed up or down. You can't really wear it over a suit or blazer, but it can look great with a tie, an open collar, a turtleneck, or a &lt;a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/the-jaunty-scarf/"&gt;jaunty scarf&lt;/a&gt;. Fashionbeans called it &lt;a href="https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/safari-jacket-men/"&gt;2018’s Most Stylish And Practical Menswear Item&lt;/a&gt;... although the article currently says 2019, and I assume it will say 2020 soon enough, because they think they'll sell you more if they lie and pretend they just wrote the article five minutes ago... But still, Safari Jackets are interesting and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://stoffa.co/products/outerwear-003-field-jacket"&gt;field jacket&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from Stoffa features a beautiful cinched waist. A safari jacket generally also has four pockets, and might also have lapels with large notches, or a few other features—the definition is certainly a little ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chambray—denim's softer cousin—is one of the menswear crowd's favorite magic tricks. It echoes workwear, making for a shirt that looks perfectly good untucked in the summer, but just watch &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedressedchest/"&gt;@thedressedchest&lt;/a&gt; wear it with a tie under corduroy above. Or check &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3OmUdFD-TD/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see it under a denim blazer. Crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chambray is one of those textures that can provide complexity without taking up too much attention. See &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/CPGfNmV"&gt;this take&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DebonaireGamer/"&gt;/u/debonairegamer&lt;/a&gt;. Pay attention not only to shade and drape but collar style, pocket layout, plackets, stitching, wrinkling, and body length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a reason Put This On called chambray a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://putthison.com/chambray-a-workhorse-casual-shirt/"&gt;workhorse&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; And Ethan Wong got &lt;a href="https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2018/07/01/an-ode-to-denim-and-chambray-shirts/"&gt;a little obsessed&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you can be too. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8zvxdh/your_favorite_for_chambray_shirts/"&gt;Here are some recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h1 id="havefunexploring"&gt;Have Fun Exploring!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, I can't tell you how to branch out. I don't expect you to buy all of the above—I don't have everything I listed above myself. These were just ideas to help get your creative juices flowing. If you're branching out past your basic wardrobe, it's important for you to branch out and make your own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hopefully, I've gotten you thinking less about the exact styles above, and more about interesting textures, metal hardware, a cinched waist, and wearing things you haven't worn before. Good luck, and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

Fitzpatrick's sample sale yesterday -- Justin is a cool dude, btw. I had some old photos of his store on my old phone, but that thing is dead now, so you don't get to see photos. Suffice it to say, you want some J. Fitzpatricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leffot is just across the street, and yesterday was a beautiful day, so I popped right over for a quick look at their selection. There were some nice Aldens and &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/GDWzY5g"&gt;Corthays&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/AAWcd9H"&gt;scarves from Drake's&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/SvHV6Yc"&gt;very large wheel of Pantherella socks&lt;/a&gt;. They had &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/pev0pcb"&gt;horns made of horn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/dg9sMJV"&gt;house slippers from Hiro Yanagimachi&lt;/a&gt;, creams, nice photos... It was all very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Corthay -- today (Thursday) and tomorrow, Leffot his hosting a Corthay trunk show, so if you have money to blow, go get some dope, unique shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also -- &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/0cy7BmI"&gt;I bought something!&lt;/a&gt; Take your guesses as to what's in that bag.&lt;/p&gt;
