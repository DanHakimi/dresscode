                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So... Who would have guessed it, we're still in quarantine. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Americans didn't feel like quarantining.</p>
<p>I've been holding back the urge to do this again. The <a href="https://prf.hn/l/rdzBRgK">Mr. Porter</a> (<a href="https://prf.hn/l/rdzBRgK">non-tracking link</a>) sale was fun as always, <a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/">Spier and Mackay</a> had some solid sales in the meantime, <a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/">Supply &amp; Advise</a> kept going strong, and <a href="https://meermin.com/">Meermin</a> even had a second sale. Meermin!</p>
<p>But this Ring Jacket sale needs to be acknowledged. So here we are.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Grey-Linen-Suit-w-Pocket.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>A linen suit from Ring Jacket. I love the way they display the sleeve in the pocket for product photography. It helps me imagine the drape and softness I know they can achieve.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="ringjacket">Ring Jacket</h1>
<p>So... <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/">Ring Jacket</a> is amazing. You should generally know that of any brand carried by <a href="https://thearmoury.com/">The Armoury</a> and <a href="https://www.supplyandadvise.com/">Supply &amp; Advise</a>, but... Really, Ring Jacket is something special. Especially at these prices, in some cases more than half off.</p>
<p>This brand takes what's great about classic tailoring and what's comfortable about casualwear and combines them into some truly luxurious clothing.</p>
<p>Behold! In example, I give you <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/tan-jersey-shirt">this tan Jersey shirt</a>. Jersey, in case you're not familiar with various knits, is the stuff tee shirts are made of. Why don't they make more of these? Well, a few reasons. One is that dress shirts are mired in tradition, so people want them to fit traditional or dressy standards. Another is that jersey isn't a very structured fabric, so it'll be hard to make a jersey shirt look good. Hard, unless you're Ring Jacket, who makes everything look easy.</p>
<p>They are also pioneers in the field of natural fabrics with techy qualities. The <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/brown-prince-of-wales-balloon-jacket">Balloon Jacket</a> is the classic example of this. A 100% wool jacket woven with completely natural stretch and even more wrinkle-resistance than the worsted wool you already love. Add that to worsted wool's natural breathability, anti-odor qualities, and all of the other magical things wool does, and you have a fabric that justifies its normally crazy price tag -- and makes this lower one a steal. Their <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/navy-calm-twist-trousers">calm twist</a> fabric has similarly splendid features.</p>
<p>They also do cool blends, like htis <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/grey-houndstooth-jacket">cotton silk linen</a> blend.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Olive-Jersey-Shirt-1.jpg" width="1080" height="1619"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Cord-Jacket-1.jpg" width="2000" height="2999"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Ring-Jacket-Blend-Blazer-1.jpg" width="683" height="1024"></div></div></div><figcaption>More of the Ring Jacket sale. This is how you make tailoring casual.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Finally... I just have to point out how great a deal <a href="https://shop.ringjacket.com/products/navy-corduroy-shirt-jacket">this particular Corduroy shirt jacket is</a>. Good outerwear does not come cheap, and this is great outerwear, in the most versatile color you're going to get, and it's.. Okay, $175 might still not be cheap to you, but you're going to get way more than what you pay for.</p>
<p>(Side note: <a href="https://thearmoury.com/">The Armoury</a> has also temporarily reduced prices on Ring Jacket by 20%. They don't even want to use the word sale. This is not as good a deal, obviously, but it covers a much greater number of offerings.)</p>

The fabrics here are great: a Drago blue gun check, a VBC navy flannel, and an Angelico check, respectively</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="spierandmackay">Spier and Mackay</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/">Spier and Mackay</a> has always been a good value, but they've also had a standing sale selection for a while. And through quarantine, they've usually been offering 25% off <em>something</em>. I finally bought my first suit from them last week when they had 25% off suits, so I got a navy DB that would easily have been worth the $450 original price for just $261.50. Expect a review on that soon.</p>
<p>Right now, with code SALE25, you can get 25% off their entire sale selection. That means half-canvassed suits with great materials as low as <a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/indigo-micro-check-10575-0172-2112-f1h1-fw19">$187.50</a>, merino wool sweaters down to <a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/dark-brown-merino-wool-crewneck-ec17105-cnk-fw19-482">$30</a>, trousers as low as... <a href="https://www.spierandmackay.com/product/washed-red---cotton---final-sale-514-33-f1h1">wait, 22.50</a>? That can't be right... Guys, buy fast before Spier &amp; Mackay turns into J. Crew. Seriously, don't expect these sales to last.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Wool-Silk-Linen-Suit.jpg" width="1000" height="1250"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Overcoat.jpg" width="1080" height="1350"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Cavour-Loafers.jpg" width="1080" height="1351"></div></div></div><figcaption>Some of Cavour's cooler-looking options.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="cavour">Cavour</h1>
<p><a href="https://cavour.co/en/search/bysearchdefinition/1">Cavour</a> is the hot new up-and-comer in the tailoring game. Well, not that new, they're a few years old, but they've still got that new brand smell on them. And their stuff is not only on a deep sale -- 50% off most things -- but, with the code &quot;extrasale15,&quot; deeper than that.</p>
<p>To put into perspective how good a sale this is, <a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/1894/mini-birdseye-suit">this fully canvassed suit</a> is going for $310.25. Don't like suits? Fine. Here's <a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/2070/nylon-field-jacket">a field jacket</a>, <a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/1409/wool-cashmere-overcoat">an overcoat</a>, <a href="https://cavour.co/en/product/2076/suede-field-jacket">a suede jacket</a>, <a href="https://cavour.co/en/22/men-loafers">some dope loafers</a>... You've got a lot of cool options here.</p>
<p>You wanna know the kicker? Cavour also carries other brands, and some of them are on sale, including Drake's, Canali a small <a href="https://cavour.co/xx/147/50-sale?p=789&amp;orderBy=Published">Ring Jacket selection</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have to support great menswear in this difficult time if we want to see it continue, and... they're making it <em>very, very</em> easy on us. Let's make sure they survive.</p>
<p>I told you not to expect these sales to last, but the unfortunate thing is, given our reaction in the US, there's a reasonable chance they will. I guess I'll see you again in the fall and winter, especially if we really force all of our schools open...</p>
<p>Oh well, at least we'll all look fly as hell from home.</p>
