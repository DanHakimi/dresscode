<p>Don't call me an influencer. I'm here to help you. Ask me questions. Take my advice as inspiration, and don't worry too much about the specific brands I talk about. I don't want to sell things to you, I want to help you learn and grow.</p>
<p>I started this blog, primarily, as a home for the guides I was already writing on reddit. The name is, in part, a play on the fact that I'm an attorney, and, as an added bonus, a play on the fact that I write software (although mainly just for fun). I don't really think you can codify style, but I think definining things can be very helpful for those struggling, so you'll see "how to talk about" guides here fairly often.</p>
<p>Always feel free to reach out to me if you have questions, ideas for my next article, feedback, or other ideas. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dresscodemenswear/">Instagram</a> might be the best way to reach me, for now.</p>

<p>I'm <a href="https://dresscode.danhakimi.com/author/daniel">Daniel Hakimi</a>! I'm an attorney, technologist, menswear aficionado, and philosopher. I also hate labeling people -- it's usually more limiting than it is useful -- so take all of these labels with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I'm curious, and I always wanted to understand a little bit about menswear... until, at some point, I broke, and started to read everything he could find. Now, I'd say I know more than you'd expect to look at me. I answer simple questions on Reddit with some regularity, and enjoy the higher-level discussions as well. I got to writing guides there -- partly as a way to learn, myself -- and that led me to start the blog.</p>
<p>Professionally, I'm patent attorney reviewing intellectual property issues for IBM. My work includes review of both proprietary and FOSS licenses, contributions to Free software projects, patent issues, nondisclosure agreements, and more. I am an alumnus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I received degrees in Computer Science and Philosophy, and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I'm still a fan of software freedom, decentralized networks, good television, and similar important issues.</p>
<p>I'm currently eyeing a blue suede Valstarino jacket, but I imagine it won't fit me especially well when I get a chance to try it on.</p>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search/?q=author%3Adanhakimi&amp;restrict_sr=1">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dresscodemenswear/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>And by the way -- feel free to use any of my posts on this site, or photos I took in which my face isn't visible, under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p>
